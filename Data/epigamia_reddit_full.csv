2026-01-25 12:33:37,submission,all,Is this normal for Epigamia protein milkshake or did I get a bad batch?,"Hey everyone,
I bought an Epigamia Turbo 25g Protein Milkshake (Chocolate) and when I opened it, this is what I found (pics attached).
The texture looks curdled / chunky, almost like separated solids in liquid. I haven’t consumed it yet because I’m not sure if this is normal or if the product has gone bad.
The bottle was sealed properly
It’s within the expiry date
Stored as per instructions
So I wanted to ask:
Is this how this product is supposed to be?
Does it need to be shaken a lot or blended?
Or is this a defective / spoiled batch?
Would really appreciate input from anyone who’s used this before.
Thanks!",0,42.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmhy57

If your goal is weight/fat loss, stay away from this ofc.
If you crave cheesecake but know you shouldn't be eating one, this is a relatively healthier option, just eat in portion and you'll be good, make sure you eat it post high fiber and protein meal to lessen the sugar spike.

No extreme shredding goals but I want to come down to 18% body fat and stay fit. I was 41% on October 25th and currently at 37%. I am 36 years old male at 105 kgs currently and 183 cm height. I wanted to know if my diet plan needs any tweaks. Appreciate the inputs. 

Maintainence - 2500-2700 cal 

Breakfast - Oatmeal 

40g Pintola protein oats 
1 scoop biozyme whey protein 
4 almonds 
3 walnuts
2 tbsp chia seeds
2 tbsp flaxseeds powder
1 tsp pumpkin seeds
1 tsp sunflower seeds
1 brazil nut 

Lunch 

300-400 gm cooked red rice 
Any dal or sambar - 130-150 gm (1 tsp oil)
Any vegetable mostly steamed and sauteed with homemade curry powder and 1 tsp oil - 150 gm 
Around one to two tbsp of chutney 

Dinner 

Either soya chunks(30-50gm raw weight) or panner(200 gm) depending upon the protein and calories requirement. Made into an onion and tomato based curry with one tsp oil. 

Multigrain rotis made from 70 to 100 gm flour 

100 gm milky mist or epigamia yogurt 

I snack at times during mid afternoons with either roasted bengal gram or yellow peas( around 50 gm) 

My dialy calories consumption is around 2300 and protein around 120. 

Sundays I have junk  food like poori or dosa and biryani for lunch but still within maintainence 

This has been my diet plan since November 12. 
I have been doing a push pull leg split three times a week. About 25 mins for every workout including warm up.  

Please let me know what you think.

2025-12-26 10:49:57,submission,all,Deep impact whey review,"Recently tried deep impact, thought i’d leave an unbiased review. 

Pros - 

1)delivery was very fast, and i had intimation from them at all levels. 

2) Decent mix-ability and taste - i tried both their on the go as well as regular concentrate, it’s the same, On the go is just the same powder in a bottle, and you’ve to add water yourself. 


Cons- 

1) Extremely expensive(4300/kg) and overly marketed- i got it only because they said it is arguably the best tasting protein, verdict - It wasn’t, for having paid that much, other brands taste MUCH better. And arguably also have a better protein/nutrient content. Eg. Dymatize Chocolate pebbles etc. 

2) On the go - The bottle with 24gms of protein powder is just the bottle with powder, and that coats 350/-!!, one can get the Epigamia(25gms) or other high protein shakes for 120 ish rupees. 

Verdict - Mostly avoid, to pay that much, you’ll perhaps get something better, I saw some reviews here saying they’re a scam, which I don’t agree with, but definitely not a protein I’ll take in the longer term. Specially when even brands like TWT with equally clean labels are much cheaper and accessible on Q-com.

Takes like 2 mins to prepare. Now i am not getting into the price but dont think it going to make any dent in your pocket . Not only its quick to make but its finger licking good.  Here are the ingredients 

1. 200 gm unsweetened greek yogurt. ( i like milky mist more than epigamia as its less tangy)

2. One scoop whey

3. 16 gms mix seeds

4. Half tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder for making to extra chocolatey 

Mix it all together and keep it in fridge overnight. Enjoy your creamy protein bomb in the morning 

Here are the macros 

Calories : 315 kcal

Protein: 48 gms

Carbs : 15 gms

Fats : 14 gms 

Fiber: 8gms

Sugar: 5 gm ( natural only no added sugar)

This was pleasantly surprising as I've seen people having Skyr in YouTube vlogs but never knew Indian brands are making it too. So, naturally I ordered a few cups and safe to say, this will now be a daily add on in my morning oats , atleast till the time I'm here. 12gms protein under 100 calories and priced almost as same as Epigamia Greek Yogurt (not my preferred greek yogurt but only to make a point). Taste is almost similar as Greek yogurt, but Skyr is a much thicker and creamier. Has anyone tried this?

In most countries (EU, Iceland, even the US), this wouldn’t be acceptable labeling. True Greek yogurt and skyr get their high protein from removing whey, not adding solids. This matters for macros: adding milk solids boosts protein on paper but also increases carbs (lactose) and calories, giving a worse protein-to-calorie ratio and usually less satiety compared to real strained yogurt.",8,,https://i.redd.it/3wvia6oif38g1.jpeg

2025-10-31 11:51:05,submission,all,Losing a kilo a week 🤤,"For the past few weeks, I’ve been keeping my meals simple, healthy, and cheap — and honestly, it’s been amazing.

For lunch, I usually bake fish — rohu, katla, or any variety I can get fresh. I take two slices, coat them lightly with mustard oil, squeeze in juice from two lemons, season with salt and pepper, and bake at 180°C for about 20 to 25 minutes depending on the thickness. Once it’s done, I remove the bones, grate a bit of cheese on top, and microwave it for around 45 seconds until it melts nicely. The whole thing is roughly 200 calories and packed with protein.

And to go with it, I’ve started making my own Greek yogurt at home. I boil one liter of full-fat milk, let it cool until I can comfortably dip my finger in and count to ten. Then I mix two tablespoons of plain Epigamia Greek yogurt with a bit of the warm milk, pour it back into the main bowl, stir gently, cover it, and leave it in a warm spot for about 16 to 24 hours. What comes out is thick, creamy yogurt that costs maybe 70 to 80 rupees for 500 grams, way cheaper than the 350 to 400 rupees you’d spend on store-bought ones.

Now my fridge always has a bowl of this yogurt, and pairing it with a simple baked fish meal has become my go-to combo — clean, protein-rich, and satisfying.

just a small note though, if it’s not water weight, losing 1 kg per week might be a bit too fast. one of the main drawbacks of rapid fat loss is loose skin, since the body doesn’t get enough time to adapt.

So I came across this brand called Pride of Cows it’s available across multiple online platforms. But here’s the weird part: on Zepto, it’s sponsored and shown as “no added sugar”, even though the product clearly contains added sugar (you can check the packaging or other listings).

Is Zepto just promoting whatever gets paid sponsorship without verifying claims? It’s kind of concerning if they’re disguising misleading info under “sponsored” tags without any checks.

So I have been consuming whey for a while now. But now I am thinking of switching the source a bit. For reference, they powders I get cost approx 3000 a kg. That comes to about 90 smth rupees every scoop, if I'm not wrong. Pair that with the milk and it comes to about 123/drink. 


On the other hand epigamia's protein shakes cost around 103 rupees a bottle and promise 25g or protein with 0 added sugars. 



So now here are my points. 

1. Epigamia is cheaper, and the difference compounds every day



2. Making and drinking, and then washing the utensils is very hard for my lazy and tired ass. 




So should I switch to epigamia, or am I missing smth important, like messing up the scoops cost or smth. ",2,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFitnessIndia/comments/1nrq5ga/can_anyone_give_some_advice_on_my_protein_dilemma/

2025-09-22 05:05:17,submission,all,Amul Blueberry & Chocolate Shake Review,"Ordered 6 Pack of 20g Blueberry Shake & 6 Pack of 10g Chocolate Shake a week ago.

Blueberry - 5/5, Will Repurchase.

Definitely very thick. Can’t be consumed standalone without adding a bit of water. I would transfer 50% of the shake in a glass by squeezing the bottle and then add a bit of water to thin down the rest of the shake. 

Taste-wise it’s actually good. It’s barely sweet which I like. Doesn’t have a strong artificial blueberry flavour. Very mild Tart + Sweet taste profile. Similar to Epigamia’s Bluberry Shake.

This is something you can truly enjoy as a thick cold drink at night to satisfy your sweet cravings. Especially when it served cold. It’s also very value for money. No doubt about it. 

Chocolate - 3/5, Won’t Repurchase. 

Not as thick as the blueberry one but thick enough to have a creamy mouthfeel. Like it’s the perfect amount of thickness. 

But taste of chocolate is a bit artificial. It’s very evident that they added a chocolate flavouring agent, not real chocolate. However at this price point, expecting real chocolate is just stupid. 

It’s also a bit on the sweeter side. So another thing I didn’t like about this. It has no refined sugar but uses artificial sweeteners like maltitol. 

6 months ago, I had tried another flavour of the 10g line - Arabica Coffee. Even that was a bit too sweet. That’s why didn’t repurchase. 

Conclusion - It’s a no-brainer to get the 6-pack Blueberry Shake if you’re trying the Amul Protein line. I would advise you to skip the chocolate and cold coffee versions.

2025-09-14 13:28:31,submission,all,"Finally! After seeing so many posts on this sub, got myself a box of these! (Had absolutely no clue these existed)","I ordered the Amul Protein Blueberry Shake (pack of 8) about 3 days ago for Rs. 400. Received it today. So, delivery was quite quick l'd say.
 
I wanted to get the Lassi, but that's been out of stock for quite a while. 20g per bottle for Rs. 50 seemed like a good deal so went ahead with this.
 
**Taste** - liked it. It's a bit like Epigamia Blueberry Yogurt but almost 60% less sweet. If you're someone who likes sugary liquids, you'l feel this is very bland(ish). But I've recently started avoiding sugar in my coffee/tea so I've gotten used to it. So, I kinda liked the mild taste. Quite thick, so took 2-3 sips then added some chilled water and diluted it. Seemed fine even then.
 
**Nutrients (Pic attached)** - Saw quite a few posts on this sub comparing this with whey where some are for and some against these Amul products. Did my own reading and also asked gpt. Bottomline was that just like whey, this shake also has good quality protein with those essential amino acids since it has casein & whey. Just that the carb content is higher here compared to whey (20g vs 2g). The absorption for whey is said to be better. But apart from that, 20g protein in ~140cals for just Rs. 50 is a bargain.
 
Will take these for atleast 3 weeks and see how tummy reacts to it (l'm a bit lactose intolerant). But if it suits, then probably prefer this over whey.

I was traveling from Jaipur to Bihar on Jodhpur Hawra, and I remember my husband suggesting I try Mishti Doi. But, you know what —I’m not the biggest fan of change! I tend to shy away from new experiences, no matter how much he encourages me.

Then, I went to Kolkata for an engagement, and it was a whole different story! When you visit a new place, you want to dive into their traditional foods, clothes, and historical sites, right? Well,  There I met this little devil, it reminded me of the icecream I used to have in my home town + the curd my mother makes. I couldn’t get enough of that.I tried the famous Rasgulla for the first time there, and I absolutely loved it! It’s such a delightful sweet that I think it should be declared the state dessert! 

Now, fast forward to my time in Maharashtra—something funny happened. The flavors that stuck with me there were of Set Dosa or the sponge Dosa which you can grab for just ₹50 at Tulsi Market, and the second is delicious misal. Those tastes still linger in my mind!

👉 **MS Dhoni** reportedly invested nearly ₹200 crore in BluSmart & Gensol Engineering. Today, much of it is at risk after stock crashes and SEBI probes.  
👉 **Deepika Padukone** has invested in brands like Epigamia, Blue Tokai, Atomberg, and 82°E. While they’re strong names, most are still burning cash.  
👉 Past celebrity Big losses in art funds (like Osian’s) also remind us that high-profile bets can go wrong.

If **big pockets with big consultants** lose such sums, what chance does a **retail investor** have buying into unlisted startups pitched on WhatsApp groups?

2025-07-30 06:15:00,submission,all,Why are today’s Bollywood actresses smarter about investing in startups compared to earlier generations?,"I’ve been noticing many current Bollywood actresses are actively investing in startups, launching their own brands, and building wealth outside of films , and it’s really impressive.

Names like **Deepika Padukone** (invested in Epigamia and other wellness brands), **Alia Bhatt** (Nykaa, Phool), **Katrina Kaif** (Kay Beauty, Nykaa), and **Shilpa Shetty** (MamaEarth, BBlunt) are now synonymous not just with acting but also with being smart investors and entrepreneurs.

Compare this to earlier generations, where many talented and hugely popular actresses like **Parveen Babi**, **Meena Kumari**, **Nimmi**, **Vimi**, or even **Madhubala** struggled financially or lived tragic lives after their careers declined. Stories of Parveen Babi dying alone, or Meena Kumari in deep debt and alcoholism, are heartbreaking , they earned fame and money in their prime but couldn’t build sustainable wealth or security.

Why do you think today’s generation is so much smarter with their money and future? Is it because:

* There’s more awareness of personal finance and entrepreneurship today?
* Social media and the startup ecosystem have made it easier to connect with opportunities?
* The culture around wealth-building has changed ?
* Women especially are more empowered to take control of their finances?
* Or is it still just a few savvy individuals rather than the norm?

Would love to hear your thoughts and any other examples , both from today and from earlier that illustrate this big shift.",20,13.0,https://i.redd.it/uvwkxb6udyff1.png

2025-07-20 08:48:06,submission,all,Top 11 High Protein Yogurt Brands in India Ranked by ₹ per gram of Protein 2025,"Hey everyone!  
You might’ve seen my earlier post and after yogurt became the **2nd most upvoted** comment in this category, I knew I had to expand on it.  


**Why Yogurt First?**

I started with **protein yogurts** because:

* There are **fewer brands** in the market.
* Easy to verify nutrition labels & pricing across Amazon, Swiggy, BigBasket.
* Yogurt is underrated in India’s protein game, and I felt it deserved a proper spotlight 

What about Whey Protein?

I **didn’t combine whey in this list** because the whey market is just too massive over **100 brands** between Amazon, Flipkart, and even Instagram DMs I got from niche brands.  
So compiling and verifying them **will take time**.  


**Now, the Yogurt Rankings:**

Here are the **Top 11 High-Protein Yogurt Brands in India**, sorted by **₹ per gram of protein**, with links, pack size, and affordability color-coded.

✅ **Color Legend for ₹/g Protein:**

* 🟩 ₹ ≤ 3.0 –  Excellent Value
* 🟨 ₹ 3.1 – 4.5 – Reasonable
* 🟥 ₹ > 5.5 – Premium / Expensive 

**1. Athena Protein Yogurt (₹2.7/g)**  
Best price-to-protein ratio in India.  
22-20g protein for ₹60.Clean label  
zero sugar, 200g cup.  
Only in Bengaluru  
  
**2. Amul Protein Dahi (₹2.8/g)**  
Amul being Amul — affordable, functional, and no marketing fluff.  
25g protein for ₹70  
Widely available via BigBasket/Swiggy  
Best mass-market product for value  


**3. Milky Mist Skyr (** **₹4.27/g)**  
Skyr is technically an Icelandic style yogurt  thicker, higher protein.  
At ₹56 for 11g protein in 100g, a very solid option for people pan India as they don't have to consume 400 grams like Amul Dahi to get same amount of protein  


**4. Milky Mist Skyr 225g (** **₹4.6/g)**  
Larger pack, more protein (25g),  


**5. Agapi Greek Yogurt (₹5.91/g)**  
Indie clean-label brand. Great taste.  
Clean Label  
Decently priced  
Only Available in Delhi  


**6.Epigamia Turbo 50g Protein Tub (₹6.5/g)**  
High protein (50g) but also high price. You’re shelling ₹325 for this, so great for a one-off but maybe not daily use.  
Available Pan India  


**7. Epigamia Natural Greek Yogurt (₹7.32/g)**  
Classic Epigamia. Tastes fantastic. Very well-balanced. Fantastic product!!  
Available Pan India  


**8. Epigamia Turbo 17g Protein (** **₹7.35/g)**  
Smaller format version of the turbo tub. Decent for portability, but not value-focused.  
Available Pan India  


**9. Skyrupp Greek Yogurt (₹8.43/g)**  
Another newer player. Clean yogurt, but honestly way too pricey for daily use.  
Available in Mumbai and Delhi  


**10.Nestle Greek Yogurt (₹8.75/g)**  
Surprisingly expensive for Nestlé. Basic product, nothing new. There are better options above.  
Available in Delhi, Mumbai and other metro cities  


**11.Pride of Cows Yogurt (₹11.87/g)**  
That’s elite whey isolate money. Great packaging, decent macros but almost triple the cost of Athena or Amul.  
Available in Mumbai  


**Final Word**\-

**Amul** – continues to prove why it’s India’s OG dairy king. Affordable, quality-first. Always there.

**Athena Protein** – cleanest macros, subscription makes it a protein-lover’s dream, especially for people into gym/yoga.

**Milky Mist** \- deserves credit too widely available, macro-friendly, and a great balance of taste and affordability.

Bachelor from India living in Tier-1 City in Maharashtra with beginner level cooking skill here 👋

I need your help, I want to start eating Greek yogurt daily for health benefits (epigamia protein yogurt), but I just can't get used to the taste and smell of the plain, unsweetened kind. I actually like the flavoured versions, but most of them have added sugar and less protein.

I’m looking for easy, quick ways (preferably under 2 minutes) to improve the taste of plain Greek yogurt without making it unhealthy. No added sugar, and I’d like to keep the high protein content intact.

Any hacks, mix-ins, or go-to combos you use that make it more enjoyable which I can do daily as a vegetarian? Bonus if it doesn’t require a blender or a lot of prep!

ps- I found adding vanilla extract as easiest method, haven't tried it yet though. Thoughts?",0,44.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1lzizqd/how_do_you_make_plain_greek_yogurt_taste_better/

A juice fast is not going to help, since juices are made up of sugars. If you say you're going to cut out ""sugars""- that includes fruits as well. 

Although you don't need to be soo hard on yourself. 

As for Intermittent fasting - Yes it does help a lot. It burns off excess fat from your body. However you need to make sure you are consuming nutrient dense foods. 

Ragi, jwar, bajra, all have the same carb content ~60-70%. 
Carbs = glucose = sugars. 

So simply switching the grain is not going to help. 

Without looking at your complete bloodwork and your symptoms nothing can be advised. 

What you can do is to increase your protein and fat intake, while you reduce carbs.

2025-07-07 05:36:26,submission,all,Looking for a partner who is has a tech background (Web Dev) for my healthy dessert startup.,"This is my business idea👇🏼

I want to start a business based on High protein dessert. Looking for a partner/co-founder for risk dilution and synergy. As the word ""Protein "" is in vogue these days ft, Amul, Milky Mist, epigamia etc. The high protein f&b market is steadily growing and I want to capture this market. There hasn't been a traditional dessert brand in India. What if we add a ""protein ka tadka"" to the dessert. What if we satisfy both the health freaks and people who can't control their sweet cravings😋. I don't just want to start a business, I want to create a brand. Brand that has it's own identity as one of the top dessert brands in the country.

Initially, planning to start with a cloud kitchen and deliver it to mobile food carts/truck and start selling across busy localities specially around colleges and IT parks which also have few gyms in the area in BLR.

Sell the product through customized mobile food carts like these (shown in the pic)

I'm also planning to sell through own website while also adding a subscription model after a while for regular(fitness enthusiasts) customers which will help in the working capital needs.

Any qualified individual looking to start a business or hungry enough to build a brand, please contact. Telegram handle:- @Pvn96

Note: the business/startup will be based in BLR.

Diet Review
Hey guys, I've been hitting the gym 3-4 times a week for the past 1.5 months. I'm getting stronger, and my arms are visibly growing a little, but I'm struggling to eat in a calorie surplus.

Here’s my routine:

Around 11:15 AM: 
Protein-banana-milkshake (250?/ milk) + 
80-100 gm chicken after waking up +
Creatine (sometimes forget)

01:00: Light Salad

02:30–03:00 PM: Lunch (2 roti/paratha with sabzi, dahi occasionally)

(1 or 2 Epigamia Protein Yogurt in between + something light like peanuts, sometimes a sandwich)

08:00–10:00 PM: Gym

Post-gym: Protein-banana-milkshake

Later: Dinner (sabzi + 3 parathas) + Some Cucumber/beetroot

My issue: I'm going to the washroom at least twice a day with loose stools. In morning and in office, around 5-6 pm. I'm worried it might be malabsorption. Initially I thought it might be due to cramming too much food in a short period of time or the order in which I am taking in food. But changed that also. It did improve a bit but still some days it's happening.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!",1,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1lp38vi/posting_again_pls_suggest_sth_problem_with_trying/

I've started doing IF from the beginning of this year. In the beginning my eating window was from  10am to 6pm and then changed to 2pm to 6pm. I avoided milk,sugar and oil. I used water to boil  my veggies and chicken. I also did 15k steps a day and 30 minute resistance band workouts. Starting weight in January 2025- 110kg(height 180cm). By April 2025 my weight reached 84kg. Then I stopped resistance training and stuck to IF and daily 15k steps .I started having milk and  oil in my diet and started ordering food too.  In a month I reached 93kg.  Now I'm trying to limit my calories to 1200 and daily carbs to 120g per day. My current eating window is from 9am to 6pm. I've been able to follow this in the last week and on 22.06.25 my weight was 92kg.

2025-06-23 07:05:42,submission,all,Lighting the Path: How Vinod Goenka Illuminates Business with Values,"In the often murky waters of modern business, where ethical shortcuts and profit-at-any-cost mentalities dominate headlines, a different kind of leadership quietly illuminates a better path forward. It's a path where values aren't just corporate buzzwords displayed on office walls—they're the very compass that guides every strategic decision, every partnership, and every long-term vision.

|Full Name|Vinod Kumar Goenka|
|Current Position|Chairman & Managing Director of Valor Estate (formerly known as DB Realty)|
|Year of Birth|1959|
|Residence|Mumbai|

At the center of this illuminated approach stands [Vinod Kumar Goenka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Goenka), Chairman and Managing Director of [Valor Estate](https://www.dbrealty.co.in/) (previously known as DB Realty), whose journey from national-level athlete to values-driven business leader offers a masterclass in how integrity can become the ultimate competitive advantage.

# The Illuminating Power of Athletic Values 

Before Vinod Kumar Goenka ever stepped into a boardroom, he learned his most valuable lessons on running tracks across India. As a national-level athlete who came tantalizingly close to representing his country at the Asian Games, he discovered something that no business school could teach: the transformative power of unwavering principles under pressure.

Athletics doesn't just build physical strength—it builds character. Every early morning training session reinforced discipline. Every setback taught resilience. Every competition demanded fair play, respect for opponents, and grace in both victory and defeat. These weren't just sports values; they were life values that would later become the ethical foundation of a business empire.

When injury ended his athletic dreams, Goenka didn't abandon these principles—he carried them into the business world like a torch, using them to light the way for others.

# Values as Strategic Advantage 

In a marketplace where trust has become a rare commodity, Goenka's values-first approach has created an unexpected competitive edge. While others chase short-term gains through aggressive tactics or questionable practices, his companies build lasting relationships based on transparency, reliability, and mutual respect.

This philosophy manifests most clearly in how Valor Estate approaches real estate development. Rather than the traditional model of rapid construction and quick sales, Goenka's approach emphasizes sustainable partnerships and community-focused landownership. Every project is evaluated not just for its profit potential, but for its impact on local communities and long-term sustainability.

The result? A reputation that opens doors, partnerships that endure market volatility, and projects that create lasting value rather than quick returns. In an industry often plagued by trust issues, Valor Estate's values-driven approach has become its strongest marketing tool.

# Illuminating Rural India Through Ethical Enterprise 

Perhaps nowhere was Goenka's values-driven approach more evident than in his dairy venture. When he co-founded Schreiber Dynamix Dairies Ltd. in 1994, alongside his father and in partnership with U.S.-based Schreiber Foods in Baramati, Maharashtra, he demonstrated how ethical business practices could create sustainable value chains. The factory, responsible for producing popular products like Nestle milk, Britannia's cheese, and the early days of Epigamia yogurt, became a model of how treating farmers as valued partners rather than mere suppliers could build mutual prosperity.

Dynamix recently sold its share of the dairy operations last Monday, the legacy of that values-driven approach continues to influence Goenka's business philosophy. The model he established—replacing exploitative middleman systems with fair pricing mechanisms and providing farmers with economic security—proved that enlightened business practices create stronger, more sustainable enterprises.

This wasn't charity—it was enlightened business. By building an ethical economic ecosystem, the dairy operation created lasting value for all stakeholders, demonstrating how values-driven leadership can illuminate paths to shared prosperity.

# Educational Values and Nation-Building: Lighting Tomorrow's Leaders 

Even as his businesses flourished, Goenka's commitment to nation-building extended into education and healthcare — the most essential components of long-term human development. As a trustee member of the Goenka & Associates Educational Trust (GAET) and the GAET Medical Trust, he plays a crucial role in guiding institutions that now serve over 22,000 students across eight schools, with Goa's first International IB school currently being built.

The GAET educational philosophy mirrors the athletic values that shaped Goenka's own development: discipline without rigidity, excellence without compromise, competition with respect, and achievement balanced with humility. Students learn not just to succeed, but to succeed ethically—preparing them to carry forward the torch of values-driven leadership into their own careers.

This focus on character development alongside academic achievement reflects a deep understanding that India's future depends not just on skilled professionals, but on ethical leaders who can navigate complex challenges with integrity intact.

# Healthcare: Illuminating Human Dignity 

Through the GAET Medical Trust, Goenka's values-driven approach extends into healthcare—recognizing that quality medical education and services aren't just business opportunities, but fundamental expressions of human dignity and social responsibility.

This healthcare focus represents more than diversification; it's values-driven integration. Just as his athletic background taught him that physical health supports mental performance, his business philosophy recognizes that healthy communities form the foundation of sustainable economic growth.

# The Ripple Effect of Ethical Leadership 

What makes Goenka's approach particularly powerful is how values create expanding circles of positive impact. Ethical treatment of stakeholders improves community livelihoods, which strengthens local economies, which creates more stable communities, which provide better environments for educational institutions, which produce more ethical leaders, which perpetuate the cycle.

This interconnected thinking addresses one of modern business's greatest failings: the tendency to externalize social costs while internalizing profits. Goenka's model demonstrates that internalizing social benefits—treating community impact as a core business metric, actually enhances long-term profitability by creating more stable operating environments.

# Illuminating the Path Forward 

In an era when business leaders often find themselves defending their industries' reputations, [Vinod Goenka](https://medium.com/@vinodgoenka38) represents a different possibility—business as a force for positive social change, guided by unwavering ethical principles.

His journey from athlete to entrepreneur illustrates that values aren't constraints on success; they're the foundation that makes sustainable success possible. The discipline learned on running tracks, the fairness demanded in competition, and the perseverance required to overcome setbacks—these athletic values have become business assets that create value for shareholders and society alike.

# The Lasting Light 

As India continues its economic development journey, the need for values-driven leadership becomes more critical, not less. Rapid growth without ethical grounding creates inequality, environmental damage, and social instability that ultimately undermines long-term prosperity.

Goenka's approach offers a different model: growth illuminated by values, success measured by sustainability, and leadership defined by service rather than self-interest. It's an approach that doesn't just build businesses—it builds the kind of society where businesses can continue to thrive across generations.

The most powerful lights don't just illuminate their immediate surroundings; they serve as beacons that help others find their way. In showing how values can become the foundation of sustainable business success, Vinod Kumar Goenka has lit a path that others can follow, creating a brighter future for Indian enterprise and the communities it serves.

In a world that sometimes seems to reward the loudest voices and the quickest shortcuts, there's profound power in the quiet confidence of values-driven leadership. It's a light that doesn't just shine—it illuminates the way forward for everyone walking the same path.

Then I stopped resistance training and stuck to IF and reaching my daily 15k steps .I also started having milk and  oil in my diet. I started ordering food too.  In a month I reached 93kg.  Now I'm trying to limit my calories to 1200 and daily carbs to 120g perday. My current eating window is from 9am to 6pm. I've been able to follow this in the last week and today my weight is 92kg.

Bacteria Culture borrow karloge. Macros kaha se laoge?

400 grams of this (made from 1 litre Amul gold milk) will have 45 grams of fat (4.5g fat in 100ml milk). 400 cals from fat alone.  
400 grams of Epigamia has just 8 grams of fat with same protein content (28-30 grams).

The only to achieve similar macros to Epigamia is use Amul Slim n Trim or similar milk. That too when you strain whey wil get out along with water which will reduce the protein content further.

Protein to thik hain but this girl is consuming 45g fat from just 500 ml Yoghurt.

I hope people would put a little brain in what they are doing. This might be a good recipe to make Yoghurt at home but please don't compare it with the Epigamia. Macros main aasman zamin ka fark hain,

I've been hitting the gym 3-4 times a week for the past 1.5 months. I'm getting stronger, and my arms are visibly growing a little, but I'm struggling to eat in a calorie surplus.

Here’s my routine:

Around 11:45 AM: Protein-banana-milkshake after waking up

12:30–12:45 PM: Lunch (2 parathas with sabzi, dahi occasionally)

1:30 PM: Salad at office

(1 or 2 Epigamia Protein Yogurt)

8:15–10:00 PM: Gym

Post-gym: Creatine + protein-banana-milkshake

Later: Dinner (sabzi + 3 parathas) + Some Cucumber/beetroot


My issue: I'm going to the washroom at least twice a day with loose stools. In morning and just before going to gym. I'm worried it might be malabsorption, or due to cramming too much food in a short period of time or the order in which I am taking in food.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!",1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1kxowcr/problem_with_trying_to_gain_weight_malabsorption/

Rest stays the same

Many a times the packet is puffed. I wouldn’t care earlier but today I searched about it and found that it’s because it might not have been stored at proper temperature and now its been infected by bacteria. The puffing is due to gas buildup due to bacterial activity and its harmful to eat now. To all those who also get similar packets, be aware. 

These swiggy instamart and other quick delivery apps are taking us for a ride.

The thing is I get this kind of puffed packet almost always. Now, I will have to shift to some other brand or brick and mortar shop.",6,3.0,https://i.redd.it/ggbnlf4o3j1f1.jpeg

2025-05-09 21:25:43,submission,all,Epigamia Turbo scam?,"Hey guys

I recently picked up the Epigamya Turbo Protein Shake because it boldly claims to have 25 grams of protein per serving. Naturally, as someone looking to up my protein intake, I thought it would be a great option.

However, when I checked the ingredients list, I couldn’t find any mention of actual protein sources like whey, soy, or even casein. The ingredients are pretty basic: skimmed milk (79%), milk solids, water, cocoa powder, natural identical flavors, and a few stabilizers.

It got me thinking – where is the 25 grams of protein coming from? Is it just the milk solids and skimmed milk? Aren’t protein shakes usually fortified with some kind of protein powder?

I’ve attached a photo of the Nutrition Label for reference. Has anyone else noticed this? Is this just clever marketing or am I missing something here? Would love to hear your thoughts!",0,11.0,https://i.redd.it/s8xrxicdqtze1.jpeg

Yeah, it does have less protein — 30g vs 50g is quite a difference. Maybe that’s why it tastes better? It’s creamier for sure, probably because of the lower protein content. Gonna try it out for a few more days and see how it goes.

I'm looking for some advice on protein supplements. I've been considering adding a protein bar or shake to my daily routine, but I'm not sure if they're worth it.

There are so many options available in the market like Yoga Bar, Phab, Epigamia, etc. Has anyone tried these? Are they good to consume daily?

Or should I just stick to whey powder? I've heard it's a more natural and effective way to increase protein intake.

The problems- per protein cost is more, sometimes tastes are really weird , the macros ( calories are more due to carbs ) whereas the powder is very lean , protein sources are questionable as some brands use soy which has low biovalability.

So a scoop of whey has around 100-120 calories for 25g protein will cost around rupees 50-80 depending on the brand whereas the cheapest bars are 50-75 rupees for 10g of protein for 110 calories.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1jo7av1/protein_barshake_vs_whey_powder_which_is_best_for/

2025-03-16 08:14:53,comment,all,,"Whenever a product says ""**Zero Added Sugars**"" it always rings alarm bells in my head... Could be amazing but make sure you actually read the label for the macros and ensure it really is low sugar / low carb, because a lot of the time these products have a ton of sugar / carbs and it's just a natural part of the manufacturing process, so they aren't lying when they say ""zero added"" because it was already there.

Premade protein drinks and protein yoghurts are the worst for this.

Also in India it's perfectly legal to list the macros per 100ml or 100g (and nobody is consuming such tiny sips from an already small bottle as a whole meal) - Whereas other countries force the manufacturer to show the entire sugar / carbohydrate content of the bottle... A lot of these high protein drinks / yoghurts will show you something stupid like ""2.1 g of sugar per serving"" and then on the other side of the label it shows you the ""serving size"" is like 10ml or something really dumb, so really it's 1/4 sugar even with **zero added sugar**.

Specifically with these Epigamia Turbo Protein Milkshake's you've posted OP, they are **1/3 sugar**, or a better way of putting it is a 1:3 Protein to Sugar ratio... **8g of sugar for 25g of protein** - Not really great but as long as you're doing 30-60 mins of intense cardio every day then no problem.

2025-03-16 09:45:15,comment,all,,"> Your point of 8g sugar is nothing to worry about at all as it’s naturally occurring sugar and not the same as added sugar like table sugar (sucrose).

I never said that, perhaps you misunderstood my point. Sugar is sugar. GI is important but meaningless if you sit on your fat ass all day and don't burn those calories. Calories are still calories, sugar is still sugar.

My point was you can get these exact same products manufactured slightly differently using (a tiny bit for the manufacturer) more expensive bacteria which have way less sugar:protein content ratio.

Any drink being 1/3 sugar isn't good at all, even if it's low GI, even if's naturally occuring during the fermentation process.

>Even whey protein powder has sugar from lactose and only if it’s an isolate (without lactose) the sugar will be < 1g per 100g.

Yeah that's 100% true, I think it's 6% lactose sugar content for the average cheap whey concentrate, which is why I always suggest people to avoid it here if they can afford to spend a tiny bit more (plus the lactose isn't great for indigestion in most folks).

You can even get top-tier medical grade hydrolyzed whey isolate from NAKPRO these days for the same price whey concentrate used to cost 2 years ago, god knows why anyone is even using concentrate anymore but people are free to buy whatever they want I guess... It even tastes amazing which is super rare for hydrolyzed whey which until recently always used to taste bitter.",-1,,https://i.redd.it/ncty2hzjvzoe1.jpeg

2025-03-08 14:27:22,submission,all,What do you order from a restaurant or meal service keeping health/fitness in mind.,"
Heya folks
I'm researching what people actually want in a meal delivery service, focusing on high-protein, balanced, and healthy meals. I’m not promoting anything —just gathering opinions and to see what people want/prefer.

One thing I personally believe is that fiber is just as important as protein for overall health. I also think eating 30-35 different plant-based foods per week is key for optimal gut health and nutrient diversity. This guideline comes from research on gut microbiome diversity (such as studies from the American Gut Project), which suggests that a wide variety of plant foods supports better digestion and overall health.

With that in mind, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what matters most when choosing meals:

Protein: Would you prefer that I mention protein bioavailability when labeling meals for transparency, or would you rather just see total protein content listed normally?(Especially vegetarian/vegan meals).

Carbs: I plan on using only complex carbs (whole grains, legumes, starchy vegetables). Would that work for you, or do you prefer flexibility?

Fiber: Do you actively consider fiber when picking meals, or do you mainly focus on protein and calories? Would meals designed to increase plant diversity appeal to you?

Oils: Would you prefer cold-pressed oils for health benefits, even if it increases the price, or would you be fine with regular oils?

Sweeteners: Would you want natural options (honey, dates, fruit-based), zero-calorie sweeteners (stevia, erythritol), or a choice?

Frozen fruit in yogurt: Frozen fruit mostly retains the same nutrition as fresh while making yogurt more affordable and consistent. Would that be an issue for you, or is it fine? Epigamia etc use fruit crushes with high sugar content.

Snacks: Would you be interested in frozen, ready-to-cook snacks (1kg packs) that you can shallow fry, air-fry, or bake—like traditional frozen foods but made healthier with real ingredients and no additives?

Meal variety: Would you like a mix of Indian meals (4x a week) and other options like healthy burgers, ramen, pancakes, Italian, Thai, etc. (3x a week)?

Extras: Would you be open to affordable Greek yogurt, high-protein yogurt, probiotic drinks, or bone broths (delivered weekly)?

Desserts & Cheat Meals: Would you prefer the option of a healthy dessert add-on (high-protein, low sugar) or a customizable cheat meal once in a while?

Packaging: Would you rather have eco-friendly containers (pricier but not reusable) or plastic packaging (which is reusable)?

Pricing: What price range feels reasonable for a high-protein, balanced meal like this?

Budget-friendly (~₹180-₹250)

Mid-range with premium ingredients (~₹250-₹400)

Higher-end, fully customizable meals (~₹400+)



And for things like Greek yogurt, high-protein yogurt, probiotic drinks, or frozen snacks, what would be a fair price for 200g-1kg packs?

Would love to hear your thoughts! What do you personally look for in a meal service or when you are ordering online.

2025-03-08 21:26:37,comment,all,,"1. Proteins are my top priority when ordering out or getting takeout. Years of diet tracking and research has ingrained in me the amount of protein my protein sources have (eggs, meat, and seafood), but it’d still be helpful to have total protein content listed.

2. Ordering out usually means I’m looking to cheat a little. While I avoid simple carbs generally, I like to order a burger or something bread related when at a restaurant. 

3. My knowledge on cold pressed oils is lacking, so I will not be able to help you in this regard. Personally, my fat sources include olive oil, grass fed butter, lard, and tallow.

4. I personally prefer zero calorie sweeteners.

5. I consume frozen fruits with yogurt all the time and it has never caused me any issues. I’d be open to that!

6. Frozen snacks sounds like a wonderful idea! I’d love to try some baked potato chips or something like that.

7. Varieties are always wonderful.

8. I love greek yogurt and consume it on a regular basis by itself, with frozen fruits, or as a dip for my chips. I’d live to know what’s your plan to reduce its cost.

9. I’m not a dessert guy, but I do love me some chocolate flavoured stuff, like ice cream and brownies. I make keto versions at home with almond flour, cream, and stevia.",6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1j6i9xk/what_do_you_order_from_a_restaurant_or_meal/

i do this sometimes: everest chicken masala (or any other chicken masala), 30g curd/yoghurt (optional but makes it juicier and tastier imo), little bit of catch garlic ginger cooking paste, half a tablespoon oil! 

ofc you can do oil & salt but adding other stuff increases taste, hope this helps a bit :))",1,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iyitzt

2025-02-20 05:22:57,submission,all,My body recomp daily diet,"Got down to 74 kgs from 89 kgs but have now hit some stagnating (I am also lifting heavy so cannot cut too drastically).

This is what I ate yesterday (most days it's a variation of this).

0. Black coffee with 2 digestive biscuits (6.30 AM)

1. 150 grams Epigamia plain Greek Yoghurt with 10-12 green grapes. (7 AM)

2. 1 scoop of ON whey with water. (9 AM)

3. 6 boiled eggs. (10.30 AM to 12.30 AM)

4. 200 grams Palak Khichdi with 1 whole roasted chicken leg (200 grams) with a side of 1 boiled potato (1.30 PM)

5. Black coffee with 2 digestive biscuits (3.30 PM)

6. 1 whole apple (100 gms) 1 whole Guava (70 gms), 5-6 strawberries and 10-12 green grapes (4.30 PM to 6 PM).

7. 250 gms Pork chilli (without any bread) (7.30 PM)

8. 1 scoop of ON whey with water (10.30 PM)

9. Black coffee with 1 digestive biscuit (11.30 PM).

Do I still eat way too much ? I'm not counting calories anymore but eyeballing it. 


I do not eat any fried food at all, no omlettes and no half fries. Instead I have a few biscuits everytime I drink coffee.

The main principle of recomp is high protein intake and slight caloric deficit, Your protein seems high but so does the calories. Not sure why do are you even taking 10 meals a day.

And why tf are you drinking coffee three times a day that too at 11:30 PM. One of the most important factor is sleep and if you're up at 11:30 drinking coffee and you're also up at 6:30 AM drinking coffee there is no way in hell you are getting 8 hours of sound sleep.",9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1itr0yn/my_body_recomp_daily_diet/

Guys, for people who cannot find the item at Rs. 1, you can search for the product and add. For me sunscreen was not on discount but roll on was. I added 2 different fragrance roll on for Rs. 1 each but you cannot add 2 of the same product. I am from Bengaluru location btw.

2025-02-11 06:18:44,submission,all,Supplement Review,"Epigamia Greek Yogurt 15g and 17g variants. 

Both Rs. 125. Calories 100 each. Tastes is bland even the strawberry one. But who's eating protein for the taste? Definitely not me. 

Rating 8/10. Wouldn't buy again because milky mist skyrr is way cheaper and same rupee vs protein value. 

Epigamia 25g Chocolate Shake 

Priced at Rs. 125 and 138 calories. Mild chocolate flavor and nothing too sweet. 

Rating 9/10. Would buy again. 

Raw Pressery Banana Protein Shake 

Priced at Rs. 120 and 170 calories. Sweeter than usual protein shakes. 

Rating 2/10. Wouldn't buy again. 

Note. All these are available on QSR platforms for cheaper prices.

Sure, it gives 25g protein, but at what cost?

Out of the 12 ingredients mentioned on the bottle, 7 are actual lab chemicals. Not the ones that good food is made up of.

You wouldn’t consume all these INS-es (preservatives and stabilising agents and acidity regulators and sweeteners) in your daily food. Toh why even compromise this even once by consuming this bottle of chemicals?

Gut health matters just as much. This isn’t about “chemicals”, it’s about whether what you’re drinking is actually good for you in the long run.

Yes, because that's the purpose. Without preservatives they would probably expire when it reaches you. Just like traditional preservatives like salt, oil, sugar used to extend shelf life, these chemicals are used.

>it’s about whether what you’re drinking is actually good for you in the long run.

There has been enough research, studies for approved preservatives and sweeteners to declare them safe for consumption. 

Unless, you have an allergy to the said preservative/sweetener, there is no reason to avoid them.

2025-02-04 13:40:57,comment,all,,"Buy a litre of Amul skimmed milk, buy Epigamia plain (unflavored) Greek yogurt small pack, buy a packet of skimmed milk (unsweetened) milk powder.

Add 50gm of skimmed milk powder to 1 litre of skimmed milk and mix well, bring it to a boil. After a while, when it cools down to become warm (around 50 deg C), add 10gm of the greek yogurt in it and mix well.

Now let this set for 8 hours (also why it helps to do this around your bedtime, so the yogurt will set overnight).

And voila, you have homemade greek yogurt that will release very less whey (because of the skimmed milk powder added before boiling the milk) and hence, doesn't need to be strained; all this for very cheap.

You can repeat the same process with full-fat milk too, with skimmed milk having lower fat content.",1,,https://i.redd.it/17hl7mc7a3he1.jpeg

I have been using some unique protein choices being a vegetarian to get enough for my workouts.

1) High protein Greek yogurt- Epigamia helps me supplement curd with a good protein side source. Is it ok to take it daily or is it too processed to consume daily.

2) Protein bars- Ritebite chocolate fudge bars. 25g of
Protein. Decent to consume twice a week when I don’t feel like cooking.

3) and the most questionable one- wheat gluten. I use it with chickpeas. 120g wheat gluten with 60g weighed chickpeas. Use an air fryer to cook up some balls(🤣) with tomato gravy. I understand they are causing of IBS and risk for colonic CA but studies are pretty divided on the same.

So what do you guys say may I going overboard or is it ok to go a little extra for maintaining calories count and taking in lean veg protein sources?",3,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1i6e17i/questions_regarding_some_weird_protein_sources/

2025-01-19 18:16:47,submission,all,Zepto Delivered My ₹950 Grocery Order Without a Bag – Completely Unacceptable! ,"
I just had one of the most frustrating experiences with Zepto. Ordered groceries worth ₹950, around 10-15 loose items. Carrying them up was an absolute nightmare—imagine struggling to hold multiple small items, risking dropping and damaging them, all because Zepto couldn't bother to pack them properly.

I immediately reached out to customer support, and their response was even more infuriating. They claimed there’s an option for “bag” and “bagless” delivery, but guess what? There is NO such option while placing the order! If this feature exists, why is it hidden? How are customers supposed to know?

In the end, I had no choice but to cancel the order out of sheer inconvenience. This is completely unacceptable for a grocery delivery service. Has anyone else faced this absurd issue? Is this their new policy, or was I just unlucky? Either way, Zepto needs to fix this immediately!

Corporate rat race, building/running your business, physical labour, etc. My personal desires are just like many, having more time to my self while my bills & expenses are taken care off. 

The best way to accomplish for my self so far if it helps you as well is to learn and setup a business on the side while doing your job but still taking 1-2 days off to blow off steam and take vacations in the year. Strategic time management that includes work and play. With consistent and persistent effort, this will let you enjoy life while grinding and one day enjoying the full fruits of your business one day and quitting your day time job.

Do you know what is common in all these names?



All of them had a super stressful job,

\-they worked hard under pressure,

\- handled leadership,

\- were young and had promising

\- had put their physical and mental wellbeing at the backseat

\- and are DEAD.



This is the face of 'hustle' that you don't often get to see.



This is the ugly face of corporate culture that you are not shown in the lists that rank the highest-paid CEOs.



This is the list that doesn't glorify working for 80-100 hours a week.



This is a cruel reminder that, if you don't care for your health, your wealth won't too.



Stress at work, irregular sleep cycles, long working hours and no physical exercise had resulted in increased cholesterol levels for me as well.



I knew the ill effects of it in the long term, yet it was difficult to leave my seat and go for a walk.



After I took a break from my full-time job, I could finally start walking regularly, eating my meals on time, and taking care of my nutritional intake.



If you are approaching your 30s and take pride in working 14-hour shifts for the money you earn, please reflect so that you live to see another year with your family and friends and wish them a Happy New Year.

I do a lot to maintain my health - sleep, exercise, walk, right food, hydration, abhyanga, shavasana, regular checkups, etc. I try not to have a tunnel vision. But I do lack in dept of human interactions.

It's just a competitive egoistic mindset dude nothing else, shut the mind off, I always enter a session thinking I'm preparing for a MMA fight: kill or be killed is the mindset, your concentration level needs to be at a point where you literally feel every string move, every rep counts don't lift it because you're given a task. I was self driven but if you feel you need motivation ask a parent to keep taunting you every time they see you eat.. you'll definitely avoid eating + will take classes to control anger & build patience

>What are some good sources of fats in India according to you?

Eat walnuts, badam, cashew, ghee, avoid milk if you're cutting, cut all sorts of mayo and cheese. Google these things consume whatever you can but make sure you eat the source & not what's derived from the source. 
Eat a lot of meat : I eat nonveg a lot lot but my mom doens't let me

>I haven't managed to like drinking

To each their own, I don't have a timetable like the 1-2 times a month.. but I drink a lot when I do (wish I had low capacity, easy on cash & health) 
Btw drinking destroys the process doens't elevate it, I dint understand to what you mentioned; I won't be able to improve it anytime soon lol 

Well as for corp life : just try your best whenever you remember just do it, now that enhances your flow or cuts it.. you'll know after trying 

>Sleep used to be a challenge for me as well.

Knock yourself out or get high AF you'll fall asleep quick or do a intense cardio workout take deep breaths & sleep that also works",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1hjxtez/how_do_you_balance_work_all_kinds_and/

2024-12-24 11:30:35,comment,all,,"I am 49. I started working in 2000. Within first 6 months, I developed chronic problems. It is under control now. I am doing relatively well. 

I too am an introvert. My socializing is limited to my partner and couple of friends who are in know of our relationship. I have some school and college friends and we support each other in work and personal lives but there are constraints there as I don't want to disclose my relationship - simply bcoz of other problematic ppl around and bcoz this is India. My clients and boss are also supportive. I didn't have that support during initial years of struggle. 

Rn I am located in a village working fr home for a few months. Here neighbors force me to socialize but they are surprised that they are not getting much leeway whereas I think they are a little too successful, making me have morning tea at one's house and evening milk at another's. One day, they saw I didn't get up to work, so couple of ladies just barged in and made khichadi for us all in my kitchen. I am afraid I am liking it too much here but here communal differences are stark and I just happen to belong to the right caste/religion for them to accept me. They laugh about me being atheist bcoz I don't appear to living a life that goes too much against their cultural values and so, they find me acceptable. During the first one week of  my stay here, everyone forced me (some ladies even did it physically) to visit local religious place every morning. But as I took stand and gave a few arguments  citing scriptures that even they didn't know in depth, they shut up. Heard their gossip 'Neetya is faking atheism. She obviously knows religion and she lives so simply. AND She is vegetarian. She has no men visiting her. No men except her brother, nephew and boss call her. She is brahmacharini'. They don't know me and so, they accept me 😞",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1hjxtez/how_do_you_balance_work_all_kinds_and/

If you are often sedentary > 3 hrs at a stretch, consume alcohol/nicotine, colas or lot of processed foods or have a genetic pre-disposition to cardiac/diabetic issues then 70 hr would cause/worsen your ailments. If not then you need not worry ESP if you are spend 10 mins stretching and walking every 4 hrs and exercise 20-30 mins thrice a week. Ppl need to watch your weight esp change in belly fat - it's an indicator of some sort. Regular walking (5k steps/day @ > 5kmph) has seem to really help in maintaining good cardiac health.

In his case he took a 13 month break for a Europe trip in his late 20s. Yes you heard that right. Its not 13 days or weeks. Its months. And this was in the 1970s where a European tour of even a week was much less affordable to Indians compared to now. 

He had much more than 98 hours lol.

He just thinks people are fools.

His life and privilege even before he started Infosys, is not even attainable or imaginable for most Indians. We cannot use NRN for any comparison. 

Also his wife told he was an absentee father because of work. A man  giving 70 hours for work when he doesn't have or want to father his kids or worry about household activities is a lot different to most people.  

So his 70 hour work week, even if he says he followed himself which I doubt, is still a load of bullshit.",6,,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/epigamia-co-founder-rohan-mirchandani-passes-away-at-41-due-to-heart-attack-12895348.html

""Absentee father"" is correct till he turned 50 may be. Not v diff than most Pilots or Sailors/Shipping/Miners/Site Engineers. Or even many shopkeepers/restaurateurs for that matter who are at work from 8am to 10pm. Also, for many issues - one educated parent attending to the kids is good enough. Specifically the reason he asked Sudha to resign from her post as Programmer at Infy in 1984 (*despite she being equally qualified and Nandan even gunning for her to be on Infy Board*.)

That said, NRN  compensated them handsomely for the same. His kids owe a LOT of their Ivy education and millionaire status to HIM.

My life is very sedentary and I'm trying to incorporate more walks since last month Google Fit told me I averaged 1650 steps per day.

I'm a vegetarian Indian so I get very less protein, and am not too keen on paneer as much as others are.

I'm a 21 year old male at 6'4"", so my requirements are pretty high. But I've spent my entire life not even meeting a good part of them and nothing has gone wrong yet.

I've been eating MilkyMist Skyr everyday but it's a little like sour cheese and not as fun to eat as Epigamia fruit-flavoured greek yogurt. But I've heard protein keeps you full and I'm literally never full but the two days I ate Skyr for breakfast, I could go a long time without getting cravings. There's also the option of homemade Dahi which my mom can make for me but she has a tendency to prioritize taste over lowering calories even if I tell her not to do so, so I don't really trust her when she claims homemade Dahi can easily replace these.

All I want is a food I can eat in the morning that's low calorie and won't make me want to eat again for a while. Skyr isn't that bad like I can still eat it and it's helped me curb my appetite but it's also slightly expensive and it's  not that I can't afford it, I just didn't wanna spend unnecessarily. 

P. S. I'm VERY new to this with little idea about the consequences but I am currently very open to not meeting my daily needs because I need to get rid of my very very ingrained body insecurities.

Dahi has just one main strain of bacteria in it which is lactobacillus. Whereas, Greek yogurt has three main bacteria strains in it, lactobacillus, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium. Which makes it more creamy and higher in protein than dahi. 

You cannot replace Yogurt with dahi. Moreover, you cannot make Greek yogurt at home.

You can look up agapi Greek yogurt it is cost effective and has flavoured options as well. Other than that whey protein would be ideal for you. In fact I don’t even consider whey as a supplement for vegetarians.

2024-12-17 10:29:44,comment,all,,"If I can sum it up in one word, it will be the gains. The gains on whey protein, for me, were better than any other protein. I have gained 7 kilos in 25 days, having 120-150g whey a day. Mind you, I have had 30 eggs per day also previously, for sustained periods(180g protein), but I seem to not make a progress on the weighing scale while on that. Also, pea, soy, and rice were not upto the mark. According to me, whey is the best, followed by egg albumin, and the margin among them is considerable, then chicken,soy, pea, rice, peanut in respective order. 
So, on a purely anabolic basis, I've seen a lot of muscle mass being added on my frame from whey, but mentally also, it makes my thoughts more stable and focused.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1hg2eyi/curd_homemade_dahi_vs_yogurt_storebought/

2024-12-05 01:51:38,comment,all,,"1. Boil the milk
2. Leave it to cool down
3. Once it’s at a temperature where you can put your finger in it and it feels warm - not hot, not room temperature - add one tablespoon khatta (starter).
4. Stir it properly till mixed. I usually mix one tablespoon curd in a bowl with a little bit of the milk that you are using for curd. Make it liquidy, that makes it easier to mix with the rest of the milk. 
5. Cover and Leave it unattended - don’t even move - for 4-5 hours in summers and overnight in winters. In winters, I also wrap it in a shawl properly, so it retains heat. 

If the milk is too hot, the yogurt will be sour and have a lot more residual water. If the milk is room temperature, the yogurt will not set to thick consistency, it will be gel like. 

Ps- Use normal mother dairy or Amul dahi. Don’t use probiotic or Greek yogurt to make curd at home. It won’t give you the same results, doesn’t set properly. 

Pps- I have never tried with carton milk, which is ultra pasteurised. I use normal toned milk that comes in pouches.


For hung curd: 
Use this yogurt. Put a hanky or cheesecloth in a large strainer over a big utensil (pateela) and pour the yogurt on the cloth. Cover and keep it in the fridge for 4-5 hours or longer if you want it really thick (like for dahi ke kebab).",8,,https://i.redd.it/pulp3rzfft4e1.png

That creamy texture is from milk powder. And they add pectin.

2024-09-05 19:35:55,submission,all,Suggestions on Diet for weightloss,"I am 18M, 176cm, 88.25 kg sitting at around 30-37% bf. I work out 6 days a week wherein I do strength training in the gym and cycle for my commute and that mostly serves as my cardio.  I have been working out for 1 and a half years without caring for my diet since my purpose wasn't losing weight but being strong.

My breakfast: A scoop of Whey with whole-fat milk

Lunch: 100 gm rice with standard size bowl of Arhar Daal and 3 eggs

Pre-workout meal- Preworkout and BCAA with Banana (banana is optional as it depends on availability)

Snack-100 gm of Paneer or 100 gm of chickpeas soaked and cooked in a Pressure cooker

Dinner- whatever maa makes, the quantity is tweaked according to the Caloric profile and 2 rotis.

This leaves me around 120-140 gm protein with 1910-1980 calories (my maintenance is 2500-2700). At times when I skip a certain meal or two which might happen, I opt for 250 Skinless grilled Chicken which I order from a nearby health restaurant, or Max Protein Ultimate protein bar/ Whole Truth protein bars, or Epigamia turbo Protein Shake. I sometimes drink a Diet Coke or Coke Zero because carbonated drinks help with my digestion. I am extremely mindful of my sugar intake because Sugar gives me acne so most things that I order are zero sugar or no added sugar.

Now I want to move into Strength Sports in the coming years and as such I don't want to lose a lot of strength I gained over the past one and a half years and wish to get down to 18% BF while reserving 80-90% of my strength. I have taken up some classic powerlifter programs and am working with them to build strength. I came across certain papers and videos that claim a carb and protein-heavy diet will help me preserve and even build strength. How valid are these claims and what adjustments I can make to stick with my goals? I am not sure if my carb amounts are correct to stand with this diet theory. If I am correct I consuming around 250 gm of Carbs.   
  
PS: Most of the dinner that my mother cooks is mostly done in Mustard or sunflower oil, used to be olive oil a year ago but our current finances don't allow it.",1,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1f9v9yc/suggestions_on_diet_for_weightloss/
2024-09-18 15:22:27,comment,all,,"Your current approach is solid, especially considering your focus on strength retention while aiming to lower body fat. To reach your goal of 18% body fat while maintaining strength, let’s address a few points:

Carb and Protein Intake for Strength Preservation
The claim that a carb and protein-heavy diet helps preserve strength is valid. Carbohydrates are crucial for replenishing glycogen stores, which fuel your workouts, especially strength training. Protein, on the other hand, aids muscle repair and growth. Here’s how to adjust:

1. Protein Intake: 
   You’re consuming 120-140g of protein, which is reasonable. To optimize for strength retention, aim for 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight. For your weight (88.25 kg), this translates to 140-194g of protein daily. You’re already close, but a slight increase to the higher end might be beneficial as you enter a fat-loss phase. This will ensure you’re maintaining muscle mass while losing fat.

2. Carbohydrate Intake : 
   Consuming around 250g of carbs seems aligned with your goal. Strength athletes benefit from carbs as they provide the energy required for lifting heavy and high-intensity workouts. Your intake seems reasonable, but as you cut calories, you might need to adjust carbs. A general range of 3-5g of carbs per kg of body weight is ideal for strength athletes. For you, that would be 265-440g. Since you’re already in a deficit, 250g carbs should be fine, but prioritize complex carbs like oats, whole grains, and sweet potatoes for sustained energy.

3. Fats : 
   Since you’re reducing calories, it’s important to balance fats. Around 0.8-1g per kg of body weight in fats is typical, so that would be 70-90g for you. Opt for healthy fat sources like avocados, nuts, and seeds. Even though you’re using mustard and sunflower oils, which are better than refined oils, you can limit fried foods and opt for boiled or grilled items.

Meal Suggestions and Adjustments:
- Breakfast : Add a small carb source like roti / iddly / oats or whole wheat bread to help fuel your workouts.
- Lunch : Keep this as is, but consider adding some veggies for fiber.
- Pre-workout : Stick with the banana; it’s an excellent source of quick-digesting carbs.
- Snacks : Your choices (paneer or chickpeas) are solid, providing protein and fiber.
- Dinner : Depending on what’s served, you can control your carb portions here.

Other Considerations:
- Strength Programs : Powerlifting programs are ideal for maintaining strength, so continue with those.
- Diet Coke/Coke Zero : These are fine in moderation, especially if they help digestion and curb cravings. However, ensure you’re getting enough water as well.

Your approach is mostly on track. Minor tweaks to protein, carb sources, and fats should help you achieve your goals while retaining strength.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1f9v9yc/suggestions_on_diet_for_weightloss/

2 half rows of packets drenched in these tiny maggots, smelling & puffed. I've only seen videos of worms in Cadbury etc thinking they're just negative PR attempts by outsiders. But now I left with only questions.

2023-04-06 09:18:31,comment,all,," If you're looking for some fit foods to snack on while you're lifting, there are a few options that come to mind. Based on what you've already mentioned, it seems like you're already on the right track with Muscleblaze whey protein, Epigamia Greek yogurt, and skimmed milk.

In addition to those, you might want to consider adding some nuts and seeds to your snack list. Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are all great sources of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. They're perfect for snacking on between meals or adding to your protein shake.

Another option that you might want to try is roasted chickpeas. They're super easy to make at home, and they're a great snack that's high in protein and fiber. You can also buy pre-made roasted chickpeas if you're short on time.

If you're looking for a tasty protein bar with 20g of protein, Quest Bars, MusclePharm Combat Crunch, and BSN Syntha-6 Edge Protein Bars are all great options. They come in a variety of flavors, so you can choose the one that suits your taste buds the best.

And of course, boiled eggs are always a great source of protein. They're easy to make, and you can store them in the fridge for quick and easy snacking.

Last but not least, don't forget about fruits! Bananas, apples, oranges, and berries are all great options that are high in fiber and nutrients.",4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/12ddwwh/high_protein_low_calorie_food_options/

## [Avocado Benefits ](https://amzn.to/3jcKCDa)

Avocados are a nutrient-dense food, meaning they are high in beneficial nutrients while relatively low in calories. Some of the potential health benefits of eating avocados include:

Heart health: Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats, which can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.

Weight management: Avocados are high in fiber and healthy fats, which can help keep you feeling full and satisfied, making it easier to manage weight.

Improved digestion: Avocados are high in fiber, which can help promote regular bowel movements and prevent constipation.

Increased nutrient absorption: Avocados are a good source of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, and research suggests that eating avocados with other nutrient-rich foods can help the body absorb more of these vitamins.

Reduced inflammation: Avocados contain compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.

Eye health: Avocados are a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are important for eye health and may help reduce the risk of age-related eye diseases.

It’s important to note that more research is needed to confirm these potential health benefits, but including avocados in a healthy diet is a good idea.

## [Avocado](https://amzn.to/3jcKCDa) Side Effects

Avocados are generally considered safe for most people to eat, but there are a few potential side effects to be aware of:

**Allergic reactions:** Some people may be allergic to avocados, which can cause symptoms such as itching, rash, hives, and difficulty breathing.

Interaction with blood-thinning medications: Avocados contain a compound called vitamin K, which can affect the way blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin, work. If you take blood-thinning medications, it’s important to talk to your doctor before incorporating large amounts of avocado into your diet.

**High in calories:** Avocados are high in calories, so if you’re trying to lose weight, it’s important to be mindful of portion sizes.

**High FODMAPs:** Avocados are high in FODMAPs, which can cause digestive issues such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea in people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or other digestive disorders.

**Interaction with latex:** People who are sensitive to latex may also react to avocados and related fruits such as bananas and kiwi.

**High in purine:** Avocados are high in purine, which can cause gout and kidney stones in people who are prone to these conditions.

It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about eating avocados or any other food.

This is a simple recipe, but you can get creative and come up with your own variations by adding different fruits, nuts, or spices.

## Avocado Conclusion

In conclusion, avocado is a versatile and nutritious fruit that can be used in a variety of dishes, from guacamole and avocado salsa to avocado toast and avocado chocolate mousse.

Avocados are a rich source of healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants, which can support heart health, help with weight management, and may have anti-inflammatory effects.

They are also easy to incorporate into a healthy diet, as they can be used in both sweet and savory dishes. However, it’s worth noting that avocados are high in calories, so it’s important to enjoy them in moderation.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

OP, I couldn’t say how to calculate the carbs or what ratio they fall when turned to yogurt, but for the macros you know don’t change you’ll get new percentages by first adding up how much milk you used - did you use the 100g or more? You’ll have to figure this out to determine how many macros went into your yogurt. 

After you have that figured you’ll assess your total yield of yogurt and figure out how many servings you get from it. Then you’ll just divide the total amount of macros you came up with by number of servings you have to figure the amount you’ll be consuming.

2022-06-01 11:04:54,comment,all,,"Technically, you're right, if we look at the problem strictly from a mathematical point of view. In reality, however, things are not so simple, and Nature doesn’t just follow the laws of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, or Thermodynamics taken separately, BUT ENCOMPASSES THEM ALL.

Nutrition alone is a scientific domain – quite obsolete if you’d ask me, because not even now, after more than a half-century, hasn’t made the transition from kilocalories (or Calories with capital C) to kilojoules (although ALL the other branches of science that Nutrition depends on have made the transition since the 1960s-1970s: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lxZZfOGXt4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lxZZfOGXt4)) and its primary method of research is to remove from foods and beverages THE MOST IMPORTANT substance without which life as we know it would not exist (and without which we wouldn't have any food or drinks in the first place)!

As I mentioned above, milk is mostly water (about 87%, depending on the species, breed, the animal’s feed, stage of lactation, and so on), while the remaining ≈13% contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.

Now, water has many unusual properties, which scientists call “anomalies” because they defy the well-established laws of Physics and Chemistry (and here are some of them:  [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7lkndXd8oTf0F-23i2IAdWPtd9Jnpy7](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7lkndXd8oTf0F-23i2IAdWPtd9Jnpy7)).

One crucial property it is that dissolves and dissociates more substances than any other liquid (hence is known as the “universal solvent”).

Another vital property is osmosis, the ability of water molecules to move freely from a solution with a high concentration of water molecules to a solution with a lower concentration of water molecules.

And a third one (which is perhaps the most important of all) is that water and temperature are closely interrelated (and you can notice this even when you make the yogurt: the higher the temperature, the faster the fermentation takes place, while if you put the mix in the fridge, the process slows down).

Now, truth be told, there's a whole universe in that yogurt you make. Those bacteria that “eat sugar” are living, breathing, digestive systems, that are placed in a perfect environment for them to grow and multiply.

They take the lactose (which is a disaccharide with the chemical formula C12H22O11: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfnaN46KaSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfnaN46KaSA)) and hydrolyze it to glucose and galactose (two monosaccharides which, although they have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, their properties differ substantially), short-chain fatty acids, and gases - such as H2, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4).

Triglycerides (aka. “fats”) are composed of glycerol and 3 fatty acids, whereas proteins are amino acids that consist of an alpha carbon atom linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable component (side chain). These two “macros” also undergo some changes during fermentation, and if I were to continue, I could write a “sci-fi” movie script about what’s going on in that “yogurt universe.”

Long story short, the answer to your question is NO. The protein content will not increase during fermentation unless you add in milk (or in the yogurt) some substances with high-protein content.

The global [coconut milk market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/coconut-milk-market-105439) is set to gain traction from the increasing awareness among consumers about the health benefits associated with vegan diet. The Plant Based Foods Association published its data in 2020 mentioning that the sales of plant-based milk surged by 5% the same year in the U.S. Companies are also grabbing this opportunity to launch their products in the market. As per a report by Fortune Business Insights™, titled, “**Coconut Milk Market Size, Share & COVID-19 Impact Analysis, By Nature (Organic, Conventional), Form (Powder and Liquid), Distribution Channel (Supermarkets/ Hypermarkets, Convenience Stores, Grocery Stores, and Online Retails), and Regional Forecast, 2021-2028**,” the market stood at USD 919.57 million in 2020. It is projected to grow from USD 1,009.07 million in 2021 to USD 2,172.49 million in 2028 at a CAGR of 11.58**%** in the forecast period.

**COVID-19 Pandemic: Disturbances in Raw Material Transportation to Hinder Growth**

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the market severely. Lockdown norms implemented by renowned regulatory bodies worldwide have resulted in the disruption in raw material transportation and high prices. Coconut and associated product manufacturers are therefore unable to continue their manufacturing processes. These factors are set to decline the demand for this type of milk amid the pandemic. 

**Report Coverage:**

We follow an innovative research methodology that includes data triangulation on the basis of bottom-up and top-down approaches. We conduct extensive primary research to validate the projected market numbers. We also derive information from paid databases, industry journals, SEC filings, and other authentic resources. The report includes numerous details, such as drivers, opportunities, challenges, and dynamics of the market.

**Drivers & Restraints:**

**Increasing Incorporation in Bakery and Confectionery Items to Bolster Growth**

Consumers nowadays are inclining rapidly towards plant-based products as they are considered to be healthier and safer, compared to animal-originated products. The Vegan Society, for instance, declared that in Europe, the U.K. is showcasing an exponential growth in its plant-based milk sector. In 2019, it stood at USD 320.6 million in the overall European market. At the same time, several people are practicing vegan diets worldwide. This is encouraging numerous companies to incorporate plant-based milk in a wide range of confectionery and bakery items. In February 2021, the Scottish Government announced that it would soon include plant-based milk alternatives on a government-funded early learning milk scheme and nursery. Additionally, the surging prevalence of lactose intolerance has compelled people to opt for coconut milk.

However, coconut farming depends mainly on climatic conditions. As the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing, the global climatic conditions are also changing at a fast pace. Therefore, the frequent harsh weather conditions may hamper the coconut milk market growth in the near future.

**Segments:**

**Organic Segment Held 26.80% Share in 2020: Fortune Business Insights™**

Based on nature, the market for coconut is bifurcated into conventional and organic. Out of these, the organic segment procured 26.80% in terms of the coconut milk market share in 2020. This growth is attributable to the increasing trend of consuming clean-label products. Besides, organic products are gaining high popularity because of the rising demand for pesticide and chemical-free products from consumers.

**Regional Insights:**

**Increasing Production of Coconuts in Sri Lanka to Help Asia Pacific Dominate**

In 2020, Asia Pacific earned USD 398.08 million in terms of revenue owing to the rising trade activities of coconut-based products between major Asian countries and others. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand are considered to be the major producers of coconut in this region. As per Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the country’s total coconut production accounts for around 12% and in 2017, approximately 2,500 -3000 million coconuts were produced. Europe, on the other hand, is estimated to show high growth stoked by the increasing adoption of this milk in numerous bakery products, such as cookies, pies, and cakes.

**Competitive Landscape:**

**Key Players Focus on Introducing New Products to Attract More Consumers**

The market houses a large number of international and domestic companies that are presently focusing on launching unique products infused with coconut milk to attract more consumers. A few others are joining hands with start-up firms to co-develop novel food products containing this ingredient.

**Below are the two crucial industry developments:**

2021-11-09 05:05:37,submission,all,"Coconut Milk Market Demand, Recent Trends, Size and Share Estimation by 2028 with Top Players","  

The global [coconut milk market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/coconut-milk-market-105439) is set to gain traction from the increasing awareness among consumers about the health benefits associated with vegan diet. The Plant Based Foods Association published its data in 2020 mentioning that the sales of plant-based milk surged by 5% the same year in the U.S. Companies are also grabbing this opportunity to launch their products in the market. As per a report by Fortune Business Insights™, titled, “**Coconut Milk Market Size, Share & COVID-19 Impact Analysis, By Nature (Organic, Conventional), Form (Powder and Liquid), Distribution Channel (Supermarkets/ Hypermarkets, Convenience Stores, Grocery Stores, and Online Retails), and Regional Forecast, 2021-2028**,” the market stood at USD 919.57 million in 2020. It is projected to grow from USD 1,009.07 million in 2021 to USD 2,172.49 million in 2028 at a CAGR of 11.58**%** in the forecast period.

**COVID-19 Pandemic: Disturbances in Raw Material Transportation to Hinder Growth**

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the market severely. Lockdown norms implemented by renowned regulatory bodies worldwide have resulted in the disruption in raw material transportation and high prices. Coconut and associated product manufacturers are therefore unable to continue their manufacturing processes. These factors are set to decline the demand for this type of milk amid the pandemic. 

**Report Coverage:**

We follow an innovative research methodology that includes data triangulation on the basis of bottom-up and top-down approaches. We conduct extensive primary research to validate the projected market numbers. We also derive information from paid databases, industry journals, SEC filings, and other authentic resources. The report includes numerous details, such as drivers, opportunities, challenges, and dynamics of the market.

**Drivers & Restraints:**

**Increasing Incorporation in Bakery and Confectionery Items to Bolster Growth**

Consumers nowadays are inclining rapidly towards plant-based products as they are considered to be healthier and safer, compared to animal-originated products. The Vegan Society, for instance, declared that in Europe, the U.K. is showcasing an exponential growth in its plant-based milk sector. In 2019, it stood at USD 320.6 million in the overall European market. At the same time, several people are practicing vegan diets worldwide. This is encouraging numerous companies to incorporate plant-based milk in a wide range of confectionery and bakery items. In February 2021, the Scottish Government announced that it would soon include plant-based milk alternatives on a government-funded early learning milk scheme and nursery. Additionally, the surging prevalence of lactose intolerance has compelled people to opt for coconut milk.

However, coconut farming depends mainly on climatic conditions. As the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing, the global climatic conditions are also changing at a fast pace. Therefore, the frequent harsh weather conditions may hamper the coconut milk market growth in the near future.

**Segments:**

**Organic Segment Held 26.80% Share in 2020: Fortune Business Insights™**

Based on nature, the market for coconut is bifurcated into conventional and organic. Out of these, the organic segment procured 26.80% in terms of the coconut milk market share in 2020. This growth is attributable to the increasing trend of consuming clean-label products. Besides, organic products are gaining high popularity because of the rising demand for pesticide and chemical-free products from consumers.

**Regional Insights:**

**Increasing Production of Coconuts in Sri Lanka to Help Asia Pacific Dominate**

In 2020, Asia Pacific earned USD 398.08 million in terms of revenue owing to the rising trade activities of coconut-based products between major Asian countries and others. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand are considered to be the major producers of coconut in this region. As per Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the country’s total coconut production accounts for around 12% and in 2017, approximately 2,500 -3000 million coconuts were produced. Europe, on the other hand, is estimated to show high growth stoked by the increasing adoption of this milk in numerous bakery products, such as cookies, pies, and cakes.

**Competitive Landscape:**

**Key Players Focus on Introducing New Products to Attract More Consumers**

The market houses a large number of international and domestic companies that are presently focusing on launching unique products infused with coconut milk to attract more consumers. A few others are joining hands with start-up firms to co-develop novel food products containing this ingredient.

**Below are the two crucial industry developments:**

* **June 2020:** Epigamia      introduced a new line of plant-based yogurt in India. It is made of      coconut milk and has a creamy texture. It is available in two flavors,      namely, Coconut Jaggery and Unsweetened. Both are free from preservatives      and high in probiotics.

2020-05-30 16:13:25,submission,all,Try to help your local food brands,"I'm not saying we should boycott international goods because right now it's not practical, but what I am say is that, why not try out some indian start-up brands of food products or local great products. It doesn't have to be for everything but some small things. 

There are a ton of start up in the local space especially one brand I'm yet to try called Blue Tokai Coffee. They source everything and it seems like they directly connect the coffee growers to the customers. They seem a much better option for coffee lovers than Starbucks where their coffee is nothing but sugar syrup. Also a lot of them are in the health snack and granola bars business if that's your thing. Also there are a ton of ice cream places and food outlets on Zomato and Swigy. I don't think ordering dominoes or at Mc D once a while will harm anyone.

I'm practically surviving on indian brands food products right now with their frozen parathas and rotis and whatnot. I thought Amul choclate would be horrible but after I tried it, it's honestly better than most other chocolate out there. I hope Epigamia gets some love, their vanilla bean yogurt is amazing. 

The free markets give you the right to choose anything, but I guess we should also try things out once a while. I have had a micromax ""made in India"" phone and I swear it was shit, but also I have a samsung ""made in India"" TV and it's quite good. I don't know how well we will do this Atma Nirbharta thing but over the recent times I have shifted towards using Indian brands of guilty pleasure food because simply they make it better. Now if you think different it's fine, all I'm saying is that we should try it out before making our minds.

No extreme shredding goals but I want to come down to 18% body fat and stay fit. I was 41% on October 25th and currently at 37%. I am 36 years old male at 105 kgs currently and 183 cm height. I wanted to know if my diet plan needs any tweaks. Appreciate the inputs. 

Maintainence - 2500-2700 cal 

Breakfast - Oatmeal 

40g Pintola protein oats 
1 scoop biozyme whey protein 
4 almonds 
3 walnuts
2 tbsp chia seeds
2 tbsp flaxseeds powder
1 tsp pumpkin seeds
1 tsp sunflower seeds
1 brazil nut 

Lunch 

300-400 gm cooked red rice 
Any dal or sambar - 130-150 gm (1 tsp oil)
Any vegetable mostly steamed and sauteed with homemade curry powder and 1 tsp oil - 150 gm 
Around one to two tbsp of chutney 

Dinner 

Either soya chunks(30-50gm raw weight) or panner(200 gm) depending upon the protein and calories requirement. Made into an onion and tomato based curry with one tsp oil. 

Multigrain rotis made from 70 to 100 gm flour 

100 gm milky mist or epigamia yogurt 

I snack at times during mid afternoons with either roasted bengal gram or yellow peas( around 50 gm) 

My dialy calories consumption is around 2300 and protein around 120.

Takes like 2 mins to prepare. Now i am not getting into the price but dont think it going to make any dent in your pocket . Not only its quick to make but its finger licking good.  Here are the ingredients 

1. 200 gm unsweetened greek yogurt. ( i like milky mist more than epigamia as its less tangy)

2. One scoop whey

3. 16 gms mix seeds

4. Half tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder for making to extra chocolatey 

Mix it all together and keep it in fridge overnight. Enjoy your creamy protein bomb in the morning 

Here are the macros 

Calories : 315 kcal

Protein: 48 gms

Carbs : 15 gms

Fats : 14 gms 

Fiber: 8gms

Sugar: 5 gm ( natural only no added sugar)

Taste is almost similar as Greek yogurt, but Skyr is a much thicker and creamier. Has anyone tried this?

In most countries (EU, Iceland, even the US), this wouldn’t be acceptable labeling. True Greek yogurt and skyr get their high protein from removing whey, not adding solids. This matters for macros: adding milk solids boosts protein on paper but also increases carbs (lactose) and calories, giving a worse protein-to-calorie ratio and usually less satiety compared to real strained yogurt.",8,,https://i.redd.it/3wvia6oif38g1.jpeg

Amul had launched this I guess in 2010 or something and it bombed in the market because no one was willing to buy it.

They were way ahead of the time back then. I bet if they re launch it, it would get amazing sales and would chew up epigamia like nothing.

2025-10-31 11:51:05,submission,all,Losing a kilo a week 🤤,"For the past few weeks, I’ve been keeping my meals simple, healthy, and cheap — and honestly, it’s been amazing.

For lunch, I usually bake fish — rohu, katla, or any variety I can get fresh. I take two slices, coat them lightly with mustard oil, squeeze in juice from two lemons, season with salt and pepper, and bake at 180°C for about 20 to 25 minutes depending on the thickness. Once it’s done, I remove the bones, grate a bit of cheese on top, and microwave it for around 45 seconds until it melts nicely. The whole thing is roughly 200 calories and packed with protein.

And to go with it, I’ve started making my own Greek yogurt at home. I boil one liter of full-fat milk, let it cool until I can comfortably dip my finger in and count to ten. Then I mix two tablespoons of plain Epigamia Greek yogurt with a bit of the warm milk, pour it back into the main bowl, stir gently, cover it, and leave it in a warm spot for about 16 to 24 hours. What comes out is thick, creamy yogurt that costs maybe 70 to 80 rupees for 500 grams, way cheaper than the 350 to 400 rupees you’d spend on store-bought ones.

Now my fridge always has a bowl of this yogurt, and pairing it with a simple baked fish meal has become my go-to combo — clean, protein-rich, and satisfying.

So I came across this brand called Pride of Cows it’s available across multiple online platforms. But here’s the weird part: on Zepto, it’s sponsored and shown as “no added sugar”, even though the product clearly contains added sugar (you can check the packaging or other listings).

Is Zepto just promoting whatever gets paid sponsorship without verifying claims? It’s kind of concerning if they’re disguising misleading info under “sponsored” tags without any checks.

2025-09-14 13:28:31,submission,all,"Finally! After seeing so many posts on this sub, got myself a box of these! (Had absolutely no clue these existed)","I ordered the Amul Protein Blueberry Shake (pack of 8) about 3 days ago for Rs. 400. Received it today. So, delivery was quite quick l'd say.
 
I wanted to get the Lassi, but that's been out of stock for quite a while. 20g per bottle for Rs. 50 seemed like a good deal so went ahead with this.
 
**Taste** - liked it. It's a bit like Epigamia Blueberry Yogurt but almost 60% less sweet. If you're someone who likes sugary liquids, you'l feel this is very bland(ish). But I've recently started avoiding sugar in my coffee/tea so I've gotten used to it. So, I kinda liked the mild taste. Quite thick, so took 2-3 sips then added some chilled water and diluted it. Seemed fine even then.
 
**Nutrients (Pic attached)** - Saw quite a few posts on this sub comparing this with whey where some are for and some against these Amul products. Did my own reading and also asked gpt. Bottomline was that just like whey, this shake also has good quality protein with those essential amino acids since it has casein & whey. Just that the carb content is higher here compared to whey (20g vs 2g). The absorption for whey is said to be better. But apart from that, 20g protein in ~140cals for just Rs. 50 is a bargain.
 
Will take these for atleast 3 weeks and see how tummy reacts to it (l'm a bit lactose intolerant). But if it suits, then probably prefer this over whey.

2025-07-30 06:15:00,submission,all,Why are today’s Bollywood actresses smarter about investing in startups compared to earlier generations?,"I’ve been noticing many current Bollywood actresses are actively investing in startups, launching their own brands, and building wealth outside of films , and it’s really impressive.

Names like **Deepika Padukone** (invested in Epigamia and other wellness brands), **Alia Bhatt** (Nykaa, Phool), **Katrina Kaif** (Kay Beauty, Nykaa), and **Shilpa Shetty** (MamaEarth, BBlunt) are now synonymous not just with acting but also with being smart investors and entrepreneurs.

Compare this to earlier generations, where many talented and hugely popular actresses like **Parveen Babi**, **Meena Kumari**, **Nimmi**, **Vimi**, or even **Madhubala** struggled financially or lived tragic lives after their careers declined. Stories of Parveen Babi dying alone, or Meena Kumari in deep debt and alcoholism, are heartbreaking , they earned fame and money in their prime but couldn’t build sustainable wealth or security.

Why do you think today’s generation is so much smarter with their money and future? Is it because:

* There’s more awareness of personal finance and entrepreneurship today?
* Social media and the startup ecosystem have made it easier to connect with opportunities?
* The culture around wealth-building has changed ?
* Women especially are more empowered to take control of their finances?
* Or is it still just a few savvy individuals rather than the norm?

Would love to hear your thoughts and any other examples , both from today and from earlier that illustrate this big shift.",17,13.0,https://i.redd.it/uvwkxb6udyff1.png

Similarly, the dark stores may have 35/- and 42/- MRP products and for some reason/error the 35/- item would have soldout in system and only 42/- is balance but physically 35/- is left. So they billed for 42/- and the guy filling the bag would have picked the 35/- one.

2025-07-20 08:48:06,submission,all,Top 11 High Protein Yogurt Brands in India Ranked by ₹ per gram of Protein 2025,"Hey everyone!  
You might’ve seen my earlier post and after yogurt became the **2nd most upvoted** comment in this category, I knew I had to expand on it.  


**Why Yogurt First?**

I started with **protein yogurts** because:

* There are **fewer brands** in the market.
* Easy to verify nutrition labels & pricing across Amazon, Swiggy, BigBasket.
* Yogurt is underrated in India’s protein game, and I felt it deserved a proper spotlight 

What about Whey Protein?

I **didn’t combine whey in this list** because the whey market is just too massive over **100 brands** between Amazon, Flipkart, and even Instagram DMs I got from niche brands.  
So compiling and verifying them **will take time**.  


**Now, the Yogurt Rankings:**

Here are the **Top 11 High-Protein Yogurt Brands in India**, sorted by **₹ per gram of protein**, with links, pack size, and affordability color-coded.

✅ **Color Legend for ₹/g Protein:**

* 🟩 ₹ ≤ 3.0 –  Excellent Value
* 🟨 ₹ 3.1 – 4.5 – Reasonable
* 🟥 ₹ > 5.5 – Premium / Expensive 

**1. Athena Protein Yogurt (₹2.7/g)**  
Best price-to-protein ratio in India.  
22-20g protein for ₹60.Clean label  
zero sugar, 200g cup.  
Only in Bengaluru  
  
**2. Amul Protein Dahi (₹2.8/g)**  
Amul being Amul — affordable, functional, and no marketing fluff.  
25g protein for ₹70  
Widely available via BigBasket/Swiggy  
Best mass-market product for value  


**3. Milky Mist Skyr (** **₹4.27/g)**  
Skyr is technically an Icelandic style yogurt  thicker, higher protein.  
At ₹56 for 11g protein in 100g, a very solid option for people pan India as they don't have to consume 400 grams like Amul Dahi to get same amount of protein  


**4. Milky Mist Skyr 225g (** **₹4.6/g)**  
Larger pack, more protein (25g),  


**5. Agapi Greek Yogurt (₹5.91/g)**  
Indie clean-label brand. Great taste.  
Clean Label  
Decently priced  
Only Available in Delhi  


**6.Epigamia Turbo 50g Protein Tub (₹6.5/g)**  
High protein (50g) but also high price. You’re shelling ₹325 for this, so great for a one-off but maybe not daily use.  
Available Pan India  


**7. Epigamia Natural Greek Yogurt (₹7.32/g)**  
Classic Epigamia. Tastes fantastic. Very well-balanced. Fantastic product!!  
Available Pan India  


**8. Epigamia Turbo 17g Protein (** **₹7.35/g)**  
Smaller format version of the turbo tub. Decent for portability, but not value-focused.  
Available Pan India  


**9. Skyrupp Greek Yogurt (₹8.43/g)**  
Another newer player. Clean yogurt, but honestly way too pricey for daily use.  
Available in Mumbai and Delhi  


**10.Nestle Greek Yogurt (₹8.75/g)**  
Surprisingly expensive for Nestlé. Basic product, nothing new. There are better options above.  
Available in Delhi, Mumbai and other metro cities  


**11.Pride of Cows Yogurt (₹11.87/g)**  
That’s elite whey isolate money. Great packaging, decent macros but almost triple the cost of Athena or Amul.  
Available in Mumbai  


**Final Word**\-

**Amul** – continues to prove why it’s India’s OG dairy king. Affordable, quality-first. Always there.

**Athena Protein** – cleanest macros, subscription makes it a protein-lover’s dream, especially for people into gym/yoga.

**Milky Mist** \- deserves credit too widely available, macro-friendly, and a great balance of taste and affordability.

2025-07-14 10:37:02,submission,all,How do you make plain Greek yogurt taste better without adding sugar or messing with the nutrition?,"Hi guys!  
Bachelor from India living in Tier-1 City in Maharashtra with beginner level cooking skill here 👋

I need your help, I want to start eating Greek yogurt daily for health benefits (epigamia protein yogurt), but I just can't get used to the taste and smell of the plain, unsweetened kind. I actually like the flavoured versions, but most of them have added sugar and less protein.

I’m looking for easy, quick ways (preferably under 2 minutes) to improve the taste of plain Greek yogurt without making it unhealthy. No added sugar, and I’d like to keep the high protein content intact.

Any hacks, mix-ins, or go-to combos you use that make it more enjoyable which I can do daily as a vegetarian? Bonus if it doesn’t require a blender or a lot of prep!

ps- I found adding vanilla extract as easiest method, haven't tried it yet though. Thoughts?",0,44.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1lzizqd/how_do_you_make_plain_greek_yogurt_taste_better/

A juice fast is not going to help, since juices are made up of sugars. If you say you're going to cut out ""sugars""- that includes fruits as well. 

Although you don't need to be soo hard on yourself. 

As for Intermittent fasting - Yes it does help a lot. It burns off excess fat from your body. However you need to make sure you are consuming nutrient dense foods. 

Ragi, jwar, bajra, all have the same carb content ~60-70%. 
Carbs = glucose = sugars. 

So simply switching the grain is not going to help. 

Without looking at your complete bloodwork and your symptoms nothing can be advised. 

What you can do is to increase your protein and fat intake, while you reduce carbs.

Diet Review
Hey guys, I've been hitting the gym 3-4 times a week for the past 1.5 months. I'm getting stronger, and my arms are visibly growing a little, but I'm struggling to eat in a calorie surplus.

Here’s my routine:

Around 11:15 AM: 
Protein-banana-milkshake (250?/ milk) + 
80-100 gm chicken after waking up +
Creatine (sometimes forget)

01:00: Light Salad

02:30–03:00 PM: Lunch (2 roti/paratha with sabzi, dahi occasionally)

(1 or 2 Epigamia Protein Yogurt in between + something light like peanuts, sometimes a sandwich)

08:00–10:00 PM: Gym

Post-gym: Protein-banana-milkshake

Later: Dinner (sabzi + 3 parathas) + Some Cucumber/beetroot

My issue: I'm going to the washroom at least twice a day with loose stools. In morning and in office, around 5-6 pm. I'm worried it might be malabsorption. Initially I thought it might be due to cramming too much food in a short period of time or the order in which I am taking in food. But changed that also. It did improve a bit but still some days it's happening.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!",1,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1lp38vi/posting_again_pls_suggest_sth_problem_with_trying/

It's a path where values aren't just corporate buzzwords displayed on office walls—they're the very compass that guides every strategic decision, every partnership, and every long-term vision.

|Full Name|Vinod Kumar Goenka|
|Current Position|Chairman & Managing Director of Valor Estate (formerly known as DB Realty)|
|Year of Birth|1959|
|Residence|Mumbai|

At the center of this illuminated approach stands [Vinod Kumar Goenka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Goenka), Chairman and Managing Director of [Valor Estate](https://www.dbrealty.co.in/) (previously known as DB Realty), whose journey from national-level athlete to values-driven business leader offers a masterclass in how integrity can become the ultimate competitive advantage.

# The Illuminating Power of Athletic Values 

Before Vinod Kumar Goenka ever stepped into a boardroom, he learned his most valuable lessons on running tracks across India. As a national-level athlete who came tantalizingly close to representing his country at the Asian Games, he discovered something that no business school could teach: the transformative power of unwavering principles under pressure.

Athletics doesn't just build physical strength—it builds character. Every early morning training session reinforced discipline. Every setback taught resilience. Every competition demanded fair play, respect for opponents, and grace in both victory and defeat. These weren't just sports values; they were life values that would later become the ethical foundation of a business empire.

When injury ended his athletic dreams, Goenka didn't abandon these principles—he carried them into the business world like a torch, using them to light the way for others.

# Values as Strategic Advantage 

In a marketplace where trust has become a rare commodity, Goenka's values-first approach has created an unexpected competitive edge. While others chase short-term gains through aggressive tactics or questionable practices, his companies build lasting relationships based on transparency, reliability, and mutual respect.

This philosophy manifests most clearly in how Valor Estate approaches real estate development. Rather than the traditional model of rapid construction and quick sales, Goenka's approach emphasizes sustainable partnerships and community-focused landownership. Every project is evaluated not just for its profit potential, but for its impact on local communities and long-term sustainability.

The result? A reputation that opens doors, partnerships that endure market volatility, and projects that create lasting value rather than quick returns. In an industry often plagued by trust issues, Valor Estate's values-driven approach has become its strongest marketing tool.

# Illuminating Rural India Through Ethical Enterprise 

Perhaps nowhere was Goenka's values-driven approach more evident than in his dairy venture. When he co-founded Schreiber Dynamix Dairies Ltd. in 1994, alongside his father and in partnership with U.S.-based Schreiber Foods in Baramati, Maharashtra, he demonstrated how ethical business practices could create sustainable value chains. The factory, responsible for producing popular products like Nestle milk, Britannia's cheese, and the early days of Epigamia yogurt, became a model of how treating farmers as valued partners rather than mere suppliers could build mutual prosperity.

Dynamix recently sold its share of the dairy operations last Monday, the legacy of that values-driven approach continues to influence Goenka's business philosophy. The model he established—replacing exploitative middleman systems with fair pricing mechanisms and providing farmers with economic security—proved that enlightened business practices create stronger, more sustainable enterprises.

This wasn't charity—it was enlightened business. By building an ethical economic ecosystem, the dairy operation created lasting value for all stakeholders, demonstrating how values-driven leadership can illuminate paths to shared prosperity.

# Educational Values and Nation-Building: Lighting Tomorrow's Leaders 

Even as his businesses flourished, Goenka's commitment to nation-building extended into education and healthcare — the most essential components of long-term human development. As a trustee member of the Goenka & Associates Educational Trust (GAET) and the GAET Medical Trust, he plays a crucial role in guiding institutions that now serve over 22,000 students across eight schools, with Goa's first International IB school currently being built.

The GAET educational philosophy mirrors the athletic values that shaped Goenka's own development: discipline without rigidity, excellence without compromise, competition with respect, and achievement balanced with humility. Students learn not just to succeed, but to succeed ethically—preparing them to carry forward the torch of values-driven leadership into their own careers.

This focus on character development alongside academic achievement reflects a deep understanding that India's future depends not just on skilled professionals, but on ethical leaders who can navigate complex challenges with integrity intact.

# Healthcare: Illuminating Human Dignity 

Through the GAET Medical Trust, Goenka's values-driven approach extends into healthcare—recognizing that quality medical education and services aren't just business opportunities, but fundamental expressions of human dignity and social responsibility.

This healthcare focus represents more than diversification; it's values-driven integration. Just as his athletic background taught him that physical health supports mental performance, his business philosophy recognizes that healthy communities form the foundation of sustainable economic growth.

# The Ripple Effect of Ethical Leadership 

What makes Goenka's approach particularly powerful is how values create expanding circles of positive impact. Ethical treatment of stakeholders improves community livelihoods, which strengthens local economies, which creates more stable communities, which provide better environments for educational institutions, which produce more ethical leaders, which perpetuate the cycle.

This interconnected thinking addresses one of modern business's greatest failings: the tendency to externalize social costs while internalizing profits. Goenka's model demonstrates that internalizing social benefits—treating community impact as a core business metric, actually enhances long-term profitability by creating more stable operating environments.

# Illuminating the Path Forward 

In an era when business leaders often find themselves defending their industries' reputations, [Vinod Goenka](https://medium.com/@vinodgoenka38) represents a different possibility—business as a force for positive social change, guided by unwavering ethical principles.

His journey from athlete to entrepreneur illustrates that values aren't constraints on success; they're the foundation that makes sustainable success possible. The discipline learned on running tracks, the fairness demanded in competition, and the perseverance required to overcome setbacks—these athletic values have become business assets that create value for shareholders and society alike.

# The Lasting Light 

As India continues its economic development journey, the need for values-driven leadership becomes more critical, not less. Rapid growth without ethical grounding creates inequality, environmental damage, and social instability that ultimately undermines long-term prosperity.

Goenka's approach offers a different model: growth illuminated by values, success measured by sustainability, and leadership defined by service rather than self-interest. It's an approach that doesn't just build businesses—it builds the kind of society where businesses can continue to thrive across generations.

The most powerful lights don't just illuminate their immediate surroundings; they serve as beacons that help others find their way. In showing how values can become the foundation of sustainable business success, Vinod Kumar Goenka has lit a path that others can follow, creating a brighter future for Indian enterprise and the communities it serves.

In a world that sometimes seems to reward the loudest voices and the quickest shortcuts, there's profound power in the quiet confidence of values-driven leadership. It's a light that doesn't just shine—it illuminates the way forward for everyone walking the same path.

I've been hitting the gym 3-4 times a week for the past 1.5 months. I'm getting stronger, and my arms are visibly growing a little, but I'm struggling to eat in a calorie surplus.

Here’s my routine:

Around 11:45 AM: Protein-banana-milkshake after waking up

12:30–12:45 PM: Lunch (2 parathas with sabzi, dahi occasionally)

1:30 PM: Salad at office

(1 or 2 Epigamia Protein Yogurt)

8:15–10:00 PM: Gym

Post-gym: Creatine + protein-banana-milkshake

Later: Dinner (sabzi + 3 parathas) + Some Cucumber/beetroot


My issue: I'm going to the washroom at least twice a day with loose stools. In morning and just before going to gym. I'm worried it might be malabsorption, or due to cramming too much food in a short period of time or the order in which I am taking in food.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!",1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1kxowcr/problem_with_trying_to_gain_weight_malabsorption/

Rest stays the same

Many a times the packet is puffed. I wouldn’t care earlier but today I searched about it and found that it’s because it might not have been stored at proper temperature and now its been infected by bacteria. The puffing is due to gas buildup due to bacterial activity and its harmful to eat now. To all those who also get similar packets, be aware. 

These swiggy instamart and other quick delivery apps are taking us for a ride.

Yeah, it does have less protein — 30g vs 50g is quite a difference. Maybe that’s why it tastes better? It’s creamier for sure, probably because of the lower protein content. Gonna try it out for a few more days and see how it goes.

2025-03-08 14:27:22,submission,all,What do you order from a restaurant or meal service keeping health/fitness in mind.,"
Heya folks
I'm researching what people actually want in a meal delivery service, focusing on high-protein, balanced, and healthy meals. I’m not promoting anything —just gathering opinions and to see what people want/prefer.

One thing I personally believe is that fiber is just as important as protein for overall health. I also think eating 30-35 different plant-based foods per week is key for optimal gut health and nutrient diversity. This guideline comes from research on gut microbiome diversity (such as studies from the American Gut Project), which suggests that a wide variety of plant foods supports better digestion and overall health.

With that in mind, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what matters most when choosing meals:

Protein: Would you prefer that I mention protein bioavailability when labeling meals for transparency, or would you rather just see total protein content listed normally?(Especially vegetarian/vegan meals).

Carbs: I plan on using only complex carbs (whole grains, legumes, starchy vegetables). Would that work for you, or do you prefer flexibility?

Fiber: Do you actively consider fiber when picking meals, or do you mainly focus on protein and calories? Would meals designed to increase plant diversity appeal to you?

Oils: Would you prefer cold-pressed oils for health benefits, even if it increases the price, or would you be fine with regular oils?

Sweeteners: Would you want natural options (honey, dates, fruit-based), zero-calorie sweeteners (stevia, erythritol), or a choice?

Frozen fruit in yogurt: Frozen fruit mostly retains the same nutrition as fresh while making yogurt more affordable and consistent. Would that be an issue for you, or is it fine? Epigamia etc use fruit crushes with high sugar content.

Snacks: Would you be interested in frozen, ready-to-cook snacks (1kg packs) that you can shallow fry, air-fry, or bake—like traditional frozen foods but made healthier with real ingredients and no additives?

Meal variety: Would you like a mix of Indian meals (4x a week) and other options like healthy burgers, ramen, pancakes, Italian, Thai, etc. (3x a week)?

Extras: Would you be open to affordable Greek yogurt, high-protein yogurt, probiotic drinks, or bone broths (delivered weekly)?

Desserts & Cheat Meals: Would you prefer the option of a healthy dessert add-on (high-protein, low sugar) or a customizable cheat meal once in a while?

Packaging: Would you rather have eco-friendly containers (pricier but not reusable) or plastic packaging (which is reusable)?

Pricing: What price range feels reasonable for a high-protein, balanced meal like this?

Budget-friendly (~₹180-₹250)

Mid-range with premium ingredients (~₹250-₹400)

Higher-end, fully customizable meals (~₹400+)



And for things like Greek yogurt, high-protein yogurt, probiotic drinks, or frozen snacks, what would be a fair price for 200g-1kg packs?

Would love to hear your thoughts! What do you personally look for in a meal service or when you are ordering online.

2025-03-08 21:26:37,comment,all,,"1. Proteins are my top priority when ordering out or getting takeout. Years of diet tracking and research has ingrained in me the amount of protein my protein sources have (eggs, meat, and seafood), but it’d still be helpful to have total protein content listed.

2. Ordering out usually means I’m looking to cheat a little. While I avoid simple carbs generally, I like to order a burger or something bread related when at a restaurant. 

3. My knowledge on cold pressed oils is lacking, so I will not be able to help you in this regard. Personally, my fat sources include olive oil, grass fed butter, lard, and tallow.

4. I personally prefer zero calorie sweeteners.

5. I consume frozen fruits with yogurt all the time and it has never caused me any issues. I’d be open to that!

6. Frozen snacks sounds like a wonderful idea! I’d love to try some baked potato chips or something like that.

7. Varieties are always wonderful.

8. I love greek yogurt and consume it on a regular basis by itself, with frozen fruits, or as a dip for my chips. I’d live to know what’s your plan to reduce its cost.

9. I’m not a dessert guy, but I do love me some chocolate flavoured stuff, like ice cream and brownies. I make keto versions at home with almond flour, cream, and stevia.",7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1j6i9xk/what_do_you_order_from_a_restaurant_or_meal/

2025-02-11 06:18:44,submission,all,Supplement Review,"Epigamia Greek Yogurt 15g and 17g variants. 

Both Rs. 125. Calories 100 each. Tastes is bland even the strawberry one. But who's eating protein for the taste? Definitely not me. 

Rating 8/10. Wouldn't buy again because milky mist skyrr is way cheaper and same rupee vs protein value. 

Epigamia 25g Chocolate Shake 

Priced at Rs. 125 and 138 calories. Mild chocolate flavor and nothing too sweet. 

Rating 9/10. Would buy again. 

Raw Pressery Banana Protein Shake 

Priced at Rs. 120 and 170 calories. Sweeter than usual protein shakes. 

Rating 2/10. Wouldn't buy again. 

Note. All these are available on QSR platforms for cheaper prices. 

These aren't something I'd advice you've daily as per your diet. These are a lot better for your health than Namkeen or junk food when you are in the mood for snacking. ",22,8.0,https://i.redd.it/smwgklo8dgie1.jpeg

2025-02-04 13:40:57,comment,all,,"Buy a litre of Amul skimmed milk, buy Epigamia plain (unflavored) Greek yogurt small pack, buy a packet of skimmed milk (unsweetened) milk powder.

Add 50gm of skimmed milk powder to 1 litre of skimmed milk and mix well, bring it to a boil. After a while, when it cools down to become warm (around 50 deg C), add 10gm of the greek yogurt in it and mix well.

Now let this set for 8 hours (also why it helps to do this around your bedtime, so the yogurt will set overnight).

And voila, you have homemade greek yogurt that will release very less whey (because of the skimmed milk powder added before boiling the milk) and hence, doesn't need to be strained; all this for very cheap.

You can repeat the same process with full-fat milk too, with skimmed milk having lower fat content.",1,,https://i.redd.it/17hl7mc7a3he1.jpeg

I have been using some unique protein choices being a vegetarian to get enough for my workouts.

2) Protein bars- Ritebite chocolate fudge bars. 25g of
Protein. Decent to consume twice a week when I don’t feel like cooking.

3) and the most questionable one- wheat gluten. I use it with chickpeas. 120g wheat gluten with 60g weighed chickpeas. Use an air fryer to cook up some balls(🤣) with tomato gravy. I understand they are causing of IBS and risk for colonic CA but studies are pretty divided on the same.

I just had one of the most frustrating experiences with Zepto. Ordered groceries worth ₹950, around 10-15 loose items. Carrying them up was an absolute nightmare—imagine struggling to hold multiple small items, risking dropping and damaging them, all because Zepto couldn't bother to pack them properly.

I immediately reached out to customer support, and their response was even more infuriating. They claimed there’s an option for “bag” and “bagless” delivery, but guess what? There is NO such option while placing the order! If this feature exists, why is it hidden? How are customers supposed to know?

In the end, I had no choice but to cancel the order out of sheer inconvenience. This is completely unacceptable for a grocery delivery service. Has anyone else faced this absurd issue? Is this their new policy, or was I just unlucky? Either way, Zepto needs to fix this immediately!

The best way to accomplish for my self so far if it helps you as well is to learn and setup a business on the side while doing your job but still taking 1-2 days off to blow off steam and take vacations in the year. Strategic time management that includes work and play. With consistent and persistent effort, this will let you enjoy life while grinding and one day enjoying the full fruits of your business one day and quitting your day time job.

I've been eating MilkyMist Skyr everyday but it's a little like sour cheese and not as fun to eat as Epigamia fruit-flavoured greek yogurt.

There's also the option of homemade Dahi which my mom can make for me but she has a tendency to prioritize taste over lowering calories even if I tell her not to do so, so I don't really trust her when she claims homemade Dahi can easily replace these.

All I want is a food I can eat in the morning that's low calorie and won't make me want to eat again for a while. Skyr isn't that bad like I can still eat it and it's helped me curb my appetite but it's also slightly expensive and it's  not that I can't afford it, I just didn't wanna spend unnecessarily. 

P. S. I'm VERY new to this with little idea about the consequences but I am currently very open to not meeting my daily needs because I need to get rid of my very very ingrained body insecurities. All I need is to be able to eat less, if it's unhealthy I really don't mind and everyone here will probably be mad at me and overcoming this insecurity comes first for me.

2024-12-17 04:12:18,submission,all,Curd (Homemade Dahi) vs. Yogurt (Store-bought),"I know extremely little about fitness because I just started but here are the details.

My life is very sedentary and I'm trying to incorporate more walks since last month Google Fit told me I averaged 1650 steps per day.

I'm vegetarian so I get very less protein, and am not too keen on paneer as much as others are.

I'm a 21 year old male at 6'4"", so my requirements are pretty high. But I've spent my entire life not even meeting a good part of them and nothing has gone wrong yet.

I've been eating MilkyMist Skyr everyday but it's a little like sour cheese and not as fun to eat as Epigamia fruit-flavoured greek yogurt. But I've heard protein keeps you full and I'm literally never full but the two days I ate Skyr for breakfast, I could go a long time without getting cravings.

Dahi has just one main strain of bacteria in it which is lactobacillus. Whereas, Greek yogurt has three main bacteria strains in it, lactobacillus, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium. Which makes it more creamy and higher in protein than dahi. 

You cannot replace Yogurt with dahi. Moreover, you cannot make Greek yogurt at home.

You can look up agapi Greek yogurt it is cost effective and has flavoured options as well. Other than that whey protein would be ideal for you. In fact I don’t even consider whey as a supplement for vegetarians.

Mind you, I have had 30 eggs per day also previously, for sustained periods(180g protein), but I seem to not make a progress on the weighing scale while on that. Also, pea, soy, and rice were not upto the mark. According to me, whey is the best, followed by egg albumin, and the margin among them is considerable, then chicken,soy, pea, rice, peanut in respective order.

2024-12-05 01:51:38,comment,all,,"1. Boil the milk
2. Leave it to cool down
3. Once it’s at a temperature where you can put your finger in it and it feels warm - not hot, not room temperature - add one tablespoon khatta (starter).
4. Stir it properly till mixed. I usually mix one tablespoon curd in a bowl with a little bit of the milk that you are using for curd. Make it liquidy, that makes it easier to mix with the rest of the milk. 
5. Cover and Leave it unattended - don’t even move - for 4-5 hours in summers and overnight in winters. In winters, I also wrap it in a shawl properly, so it retains heat. 

If the milk is too hot, the yogurt will be sour and have a lot more residual water. If the milk is room temperature, the yogurt will not set to thick consistency, it will be gel like. 

Ps- Use normal mother dairy or Amul dahi. Don’t use probiotic or Greek yogurt to make curd at home. It won’t give you the same results, doesn’t set properly. 

Pps- I have never tried with carton milk, which is ultra pasteurised. I use normal toned milk that comes in pouches.


For hung curd: 
Use this yogurt. Put a hanky or cheesecloth in a large strainer over a big utensil (pateela) and pour the yogurt on the cloth. Cover and keep it in the fridge for 4-5 hours or longer if you want it really thick (like for dahi ke kebab).",7,,https://i.redd.it/pulp3rzfft4e1.png

Went to Amazon, searched for yoghurt culture costed me around Rs400 for two culture used one and in around Rs80 I was getting 400 grams of Greek yoghurt, I had to strain the water else it is yoghurt only. Now I can set the yoghurt in the same way as curd at home. 

One thing I did not like with curd was mixing whey in it, it tasted so bad. With yoghurt, the whole thing tasted so good. 

It could be because of protein powder as well, I used myprotein chocolate brownie as I got it for sale.

Based on what you've already mentioned, it seems like you're already on the right track with Muscleblaze whey protein, Epigamia Greek yogurt, and skimmed milk.

In addition to those, you might want to consider adding some nuts and seeds to your snack list. Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are all great sources of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. They're perfect for snacking on between meals or adding to your protein shake.

Another option that you might want to try is roasted chickpeas. They're super easy to make at home, and they're a great snack that's high in protein and fiber. You can also buy pre-made roasted chickpeas if you're short on time.

If you're looking for a tasty protein bar with 20g of protein, Quest Bars, MusclePharm Combat Crunch, and BSN Syntha-6 Edge Protein Bars are all great options. They come in a variety of flavors, so you can choose the one that suits your taste buds the best.

And of course, boiled eggs are always a great source of protein. They're easy to make, and you can store them in the fridge for quick and easy snacking.

Last but not least, don't forget about fruits! Bananas, apples, oranges, and berries are all great options that are high in fiber and nutrients.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/12ddwwh/high_protein_low_calorie_food_options/

## [Avocado Benefits ](https://amzn.to/3jcKCDa)

Avocados are a nutrient-dense food, meaning they are high in beneficial nutrients while relatively low in calories. Some of the potential health benefits of eating avocados include:

Heart health: Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats, which can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.

Weight management: Avocados are high in fiber and healthy fats, which can help keep you feeling full and satisfied, making it easier to manage weight.

Improved digestion: Avocados are high in fiber, which can help promote regular bowel movements and prevent constipation.

Increased nutrient absorption: Avocados are a good source of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, and research suggests that eating avocados with other nutrient-rich foods can help the body absorb more of these vitamins.

Reduced inflammation: Avocados contain compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.

Eye health: Avocados are a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are important for eye health and may help reduce the risk of age-related eye diseases.

It’s important to note that more research is needed to confirm these potential health benefits, but including avocados in a healthy diet is a good idea.

## [Avocado](https://amzn.to/3jcKCDa) Side Effects

Avocados are generally considered safe for most people to eat, but there are a few potential side effects to be aware of:

**Allergic reactions:** Some people may be allergic to avocados, which can cause symptoms such as itching, rash, hives, and difficulty breathing.

Interaction with blood-thinning medications: Avocados contain a compound called vitamin K, which can affect the way blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin, work. If you take blood-thinning medications, it’s important to talk to your doctor before incorporating large amounts of avocado into your diet.

**High in calories:** Avocados are high in calories, so if you’re trying to lose weight, it’s important to be mindful of portion sizes.

**High FODMAPs:** Avocados are high in FODMAPs, which can cause digestive issues such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea in people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or other digestive disorders.

**Interaction with latex:** People who are sensitive to latex may also react to avocados and related fruits such as bananas and kiwi.

**High in purine:** Avocados are high in purine, which can cause gout and kidney stones in people who are prone to these conditions.

It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about eating avocados or any other food.

## How To Make An Avocado Guacamole

Guacamole is a classic Mexican dip that is easy to make at home. Here is a simple recipe for making guacamole:

**Ingredients:**

2 ripe avocados

1/4 cup diced red onion

1/4 cup diced tomatoes

2 tablespoons chopped cilantro

1 clove of garlic, minced

1 lime, juiced

Salt and pepper, to taste

**Directions:**

Cut the avocados in half and remove the pit. Scoop out the avocado flesh and place it in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

Mash the avocado with a fork or a potato masher until it reaches your desired consistency.

Add the diced red onion, tomatoes, cilantro, and minced garlic to the bowl. Stir everything together.

Squeeze the lime juice over the mixture and stir.

2021-11-24 08:21:29,submission,all,"Coconut Milk Market Share, Size, Global Industry Analysis, Key Growth Drivers Trends, Segments, Opportunity and Forecast 2028","  

The global [coconut milk market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/coconut-milk-market-105439) is set to gain traction from the increasing awareness among consumers about the health benefits associated with vegan diet. The Plant Based Foods Association published its data in 2020 mentioning that the sales of plant-based milk surged by 5% the same year in the U.S. Companies are also grabbing this opportunity to launch their products in the market. As per a report by Fortune Business Insights™, titled, “**Coconut Milk Market Size, Share & COVID-19 Impact Analysis, By Nature (Organic, Conventional), Form (Powder and Liquid), Distribution Channel (Supermarkets/ Hypermarkets, Convenience Stores, Grocery Stores, and Online Retails), and Regional Forecast, 2021-2028**,” the market stood at USD 919.57 million in 2020. It is projected to grow from USD 1,009.07 million in 2021 to USD 2,172.49 million in 2028 at a CAGR of 11.58**%** in the forecast period.

**COVID-19 Pandemic: Disturbances in Raw Material Transportation to Hinder Growth**

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the market severely. Lockdown norms implemented by renowned regulatory bodies worldwide have resulted in the disruption in raw material transportation and high prices. Coconut and associated product manufacturers are therefore unable to continue their manufacturing processes. These factors are set to decline the demand for this type of milk amid the pandemic. 

**Report Coverage:**

We follow an innovative research methodology that includes data triangulation on the basis of bottom-up and top-down approaches. We conduct extensive primary research to validate the projected market numbers. We also derive information from paid databases, industry journals, SEC filings, and other authentic resources. The report includes numerous details, such as drivers, opportunities, challenges, and dynamics of the market.

**Drivers & Restraints:**

**Increasing Incorporation in Bakery and Confectionery Items to Bolster Growth**

Consumers nowadays are inclining rapidly towards plant-based products as they are considered to be healthier and safer, compared to animal-originated products. The Vegan Society, for instance, declared that in Europe, the U.K. is showcasing an exponential growth in its plant-based milk sector. In 2019, it stood at USD 320.6 million in the overall European market. At the same time, several people are practicing vegan diets worldwide. This is encouraging numerous companies to incorporate plant-based milk in a wide range of confectionery and bakery items. In February 2021, the Scottish Government announced that it would soon include plant-based milk alternatives on a government-funded early learning milk scheme and nursery. Additionally, the surging prevalence of lactose intolerance has compelled people to opt for coconut milk.

However, coconut farming depends mainly on climatic conditions. As the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing, the global climatic conditions are also changing at a fast pace. Therefore, the frequent harsh weather conditions may hamper the coconut milk market growth in the near future.

**Segments:**

**Organic Segment Held 26.80% Share in 2020: Fortune Business Insights™**

Based on nature, the market for coconut is bifurcated into conventional and organic. Out of these, the organic segment procured 26.80% in terms of the coconut milk market share in 2020. This growth is attributable to the increasing trend of consuming clean-label products. Besides, organic products are gaining high popularity because of the rising demand for pesticide and chemical-free products from consumers.

**Regional Insights:**

**Increasing Production of Coconuts in Sri Lanka to Help Asia Pacific Dominate**

In 2020, Asia Pacific earned USD 398.08 million in terms of revenue owing to the rising trade activities of coconut-based products between major Asian countries and others. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand are considered to be the major producers of coconut in this region. As per Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the country’s total coconut production accounts for around 12% and in 2017, approximately 2,500 -3000 million coconuts were produced. Europe, on the other hand, is estimated to show high growth stoked by the increasing adoption of this milk in numerous bakery products, such as cookies, pies, and cakes.

**Competitive Landscape:**

**Key Players Focus on Introducing New Products to Attract More Consumers**

The market houses a large number of international and domestic companies that are presently focusing on launching unique products infused with coconut milk to attract more consumers. A few others are joining hands with start-up firms to co-develop novel food products containing this ingredient.

**Below are the two crucial industry developments:**

&#x200B;

* **June 2020:** Epigamia      introduced a new line of plant-based yogurt in India. It is made of      coconut milk and has a creamy texture. It is available in two flavors,      namely, Coconut Jaggery and Unsweetened. Both are free from preservatives      and high in probiotics.
* **March 2020**: Kite Hill      unveiled two new products, including Kite Hill Sour Cream Alternative, a      plant-based sour cream made with almond milk and coconut, as well as Kite      Hill Blissful, a creamy and thick range of yoghurts made of coconut milk.

2020-05-30 16:13:25,submission,all,Try to help your local food brands,"I'm not saying we should boycott international goods because right now it's not practical, but what I am say is that, why not try out some indian start-up brands of food products or local great products. It doesn't have to be for everything but some small things. 

There are a ton of start up in the local space especially one brand I'm yet to try called Blue Tokai Coffee. They source everything and it seems like they directly connect the coffee growers to the customers. They seem a much better option for coffee lovers than Starbucks where their coffee is nothing but sugar syrup. Also a lot of them are in the health snack and granola bars business if that's your thing. Also there are a ton of ice cream places and food outlets on Zomato and Swigy. I don't think ordering dominoes or at Mc D once a while will harm anyone.

I'm practically surviving on indian brands food products right now with their frozen parathas and rotis and whatnot. I thought Amul choclate would be horrible but after I tried it, it's honestly better than most other chocolate out there. I hope Epigamia gets some love, their vanilla bean yogurt is amazing. 

The free markets give you the right to choose anything, but I guess we should also try things out once a while. I have had a micromax ""made in India"" phone and I swear it was shit, but also I have a samsung ""made in India"" TV and it's quite good. I don't know how well we will do this Atma Nirbharta thing but over the recent times I have shifted towards using Indian brands of guilty pleasure food because simply they make it better. Now if you think different it's fine, all I'm saying is that we should try it out before making our minds.

No extreme shredding goals but I want to come down to 18% body fat and stay fit. I was 41% on October 25th and currently at 37%. I am 36 years old male at 105 kgs currently and 183 cm height.

Around one to two tbsp of chutney 

Dinner 

Either soya chunks(30-50gm raw weight) or panner(200 gm) depending upon the protein and calories requirement. Made into an onion and tomato based curry with one tsp oil. 

Multigrain rotis made from 70 to 100 gm flour 

100 gm milky mist or epigamia yogurt

By April 2025 my weight reached 84kg. Then I stopped resistance training and stuck to IF and daily 15k steps .I started having milk and  oil in my diet and started ordering food too.  In a month I reached 93kg.  Now I'm trying to limit my calories to 1200 and daily carbs to 120g per day. My current eating window is from 9am to 6pm. I've been able to follow this in the last week and on 22.06.25 my weight was 92kg.

2025-06-22 15:12:07,submission,all,My intermittent fasting 16:8,"I've started doing IF from the beginning of this year. In the beginning my eating window was from  10am to 6pm and then chaged nto 2pm to 6pm. I avoided milk,sugar and oil. I used to use water to boil  my veggies and chicken. I also did 15k steps a day and did half hour of resistance band workouts. Starting weight 110kg. On April 2025 my weight reached 84kg. Then I stopped resistance training and stuck to IF and reaching my daily 15k steps .I also started having milk and  oil in my diet. I started ordering food too.  In a month I reached 93kg.  Now I'm trying to limit my calories to 1200 and daily carbs to 120g perday. My current eating window is from 9am to 6pm. I've been able to follow this in the last week and today my weight is 92kg.

2025-03-08 14:27:22,submission,all,What do you order from a restaurant or meal service keeping health/fitness in mind.,"
Heya folks
I'm researching what people actually want in a meal delivery service, focusing on high-protein, balanced, and healthy meals. I’m not promoting anything —just gathering opinions and to see what people want/prefer.

One thing I personally believe is that fiber is just as important as protein for overall health. I also think eating 30-35 different plant-based foods per week is key for optimal gut health and nutrient diversity. This guideline comes from research on gut microbiome diversity (such as studies from the American Gut Project), which suggests that a wide variety of plant foods supports better digestion and overall health.

With that in mind, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what matters most when choosing meals:

Protein: Would you prefer that I mention protein bioavailability when labeling meals for transparency, or would you rather just see total protein content listed normally?(Especially vegetarian/vegan meals).

Carbs: I plan on using only complex carbs (whole grains, legumes, starchy vegetables). Would that work for you, or do you prefer flexibility?

Fiber: Do you actively consider fiber when picking meals, or do you mainly focus on protein and calories? Would meals designed to increase plant diversity appeal to you?

Oils: Would you prefer cold-pressed oils for health benefits, even if it increases the price, or would you be fine with regular oils?

Sweeteners: Would you want natural options (honey, dates, fruit-based), zero-calorie sweeteners (stevia, erythritol), or a choice?

Frozen fruit in yogurt: Frozen fruit mostly retains the same nutrition as fresh while making yogurt more affordable and consistent. Would that be an issue for you, or is it fine? Epigamia etc use fruit crushes with high sugar content.

Snacks: Would you be interested in frozen, ready-to-cook snacks (1kg packs) that you can shallow fry, air-fry, or bake—like traditional frozen foods but made healthier with real ingredients and no additives?

Meal variety: Would you like a mix of Indian meals (4x a week) and other options like healthy burgers, ramen, pancakes, Italian, Thai, etc. (3x a week)?

Extras: Would you be open to affordable Greek yogurt, high-protein yogurt, probiotic drinks, or bone broths (delivered weekly)?

Desserts & Cheat Meals: Would you prefer the option of a healthy dessert add-on (high-protein, low sugar) or a customizable cheat meal once in a while?

Packaging: Would you rather have eco-friendly containers (pricier but not reusable) or plastic packaging (which is reusable)?

Pricing: What price range feels reasonable for a high-protein, balanced meal like this?

Budget-friendly (~₹180-₹250)

Mid-range with premium ingredients (~₹250-₹400)

Higher-end, fully customizable meals (~₹400+)



And for things like Greek yogurt, high-protein yogurt, probiotic drinks, or frozen snacks, what would be a fair price for 200g-1kg packs?

Would love to hear your thoughts! What do you personally look for in a meal service or when you are ordering online.

2025-03-08 21:26:37,comment,all,,"1. Proteins are my top priority when ordering out or getting takeout. Years of diet tracking and research has ingrained in me the amount of protein my protein sources have (eggs, meat, and seafood), but it’d still be helpful to have total protein content listed.

2. Ordering out usually means I’m looking to cheat a little. While I avoid simple carbs generally, I like to order a burger or something bread related when at a restaurant. 

3. My knowledge on cold pressed oils is lacking, so I will not be able to help you in this regard. Personally, my fat sources include olive oil, grass fed butter, lard, and tallow.

4. I personally prefer zero calorie sweeteners.

5. I consume frozen fruits with yogurt all the time and it has never caused me any issues. I’d be open to that!

6. Frozen snacks sounds like a wonderful idea! I’d love to try some baked potato chips or something like that.

7. Varieties are always wonderful.

8. I love greek yogurt and consume it on a regular basis by itself, with frozen fruits, or as a dip for my chips. I’d live to know what’s your plan to reduce its cost.

9. I’m not a dessert guy, but I do love me some chocolate flavoured stuff, like ice cream and brownies. I make keto versions at home with almond flour, cream, and stevia.",6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1j6i9xk/what_do_you_order_from_a_restaurant_or_meal/

Both Rs. 125. Calories 100 each. Tastes is bland even the strawberry one. But who's eating protein for the taste? Definitely not me. 

Rating 8/10. Wouldn't buy again because milky mist skyrr is way cheaper and same rupee vs protein value. 

Epigamia 25g Chocolate Shake 

Priced at Rs. 125 and 138 calories. Mild chocolate flavor and nothing too sweet. 

Rating 9/10. Would buy again. 

Raw Pressery Banana Protein Shake 

Priced at Rs. 120 and 170 calories. Sweeter than usual protein shakes. 

Rating 2/10. Wouldn't buy again. 

Note. All these are available on QSR platforms for cheaper prices.

2024-09-05 19:35:55,submission,all,Suggestions on Diet for weightloss,"I am 18M, 176cm, 88.25 kg sitting at around 30-37% bf. I work out 6 days a week wherein I do strength training in the gym and cycle for my commute and that mostly serves as my cardio.  I have been working out for 1 and a half years without caring for my diet since my purpose wasn't losing weight but being strong.

My breakfast: A scoop of Whey with whole-fat milk

Lunch: 100 gm rice with standard size bowl of Arhar Daal and 3 eggs

Pre-workout meal- Preworkout and BCAA with Banana (banana is optional as it depends on availability)

Snack-100 gm of Paneer or 100 gm of chickpeas soaked and cooked in a Pressure cooker

Dinner- whatever maa makes, the quantity is tweaked according to the Caloric profile and 2 rotis.

This leaves me around 120-140 gm protein with 1910-1980 calories (my maintenance is 2500-2700). At times when I skip a certain meal or two which might happen, I opt for 250 Skinless grilled Chicken which I order from a nearby health restaurant, or Max Protein Ultimate protein bar/ Whole Truth protein bars, or Epigamia turbo Protein Shake. I sometimes drink a Diet Coke or Coke Zero because carbonated drinks help with my digestion. I am extremely mindful of my sugar intake because Sugar gives me acne so most things that I order are zero sugar or no added sugar.

Now I want to move into Strength Sports in the coming years and as such I don't want to lose a lot of strength I gained over the past one and a half years and wish to get down to 18% BF while reserving 80-90% of my strength. I have taken up some classic powerlifter programs and am working with them to build strength. I came across certain papers and videos that claim a carb and protein-heavy diet will help me preserve and even build strength. How valid are these claims and what adjustments I can make to stick with my goals? I am not sure if my carb amounts are correct to stand with this diet theory. If I am correct I consuming around 250 gm of Carbs.   
  
PS: Most of the dinner that my mother cooks is mostly done in Mustard or sunflower oil, used to be olive oil a year ago but our current finances don't allow it.",1,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1f9v9yc/suggestions_on_diet_for_weightloss/
2024-09-18 15:22:27,comment,all,,"Your current approach is solid, especially considering your focus on strength retention while aiming to lower body fat. To reach your goal of 18% body fat while maintaining strength, let’s address a few points:

Carb and Protein Intake for Strength Preservation
The claim that a carb and protein-heavy diet helps preserve strength is valid. Carbohydrates are crucial for replenishing glycogen stores, which fuel your workouts, especially strength training. Protein, on the other hand, aids muscle repair and growth. Here’s how to adjust:

1. Protein Intake: 
   You’re consuming 120-140g of protein, which is reasonable. To optimize for strength retention, aim for 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight. For your weight (88.25 kg), this translates to 140-194g of protein daily. You’re already close, but a slight increase to the higher end might be beneficial as you enter a fat-loss phase. This will ensure you’re maintaining muscle mass while losing fat.

2. Carbohydrate Intake : 
   Consuming around 250g of carbs seems aligned with your goal. Strength athletes benefit from carbs as they provide the energy required for lifting heavy and high-intensity workouts. Your intake seems reasonable, but as you cut calories, you might need to adjust carbs. A general range of 3-5g of carbs per kg of body weight is ideal for strength athletes. For you, that would be 265-440g. Since you’re already in a deficit, 250g carbs should be fine, but prioritize complex carbs like oats, whole grains, and sweet potatoes for sustained energy.

3. Fats : 
   Since you’re reducing calories, it’s important to balance fats. Around 0.8-1g per kg of body weight in fats is typical, so that would be 70-90g for you. Opt for healthy fat sources like avocados, nuts, and seeds. Even though you’re using mustard and sunflower oils, which are better than refined oils, you can limit fried foods and opt for boiled or grilled items.

Meal Suggestions and Adjustments:
- Breakfast : Add a small carb source like roti / iddly / oats or whole wheat bread to help fuel your workouts.
- Lunch : Keep this as is, but consider adding some veggies for fiber.
- Pre-workout : Stick with the banana; it’s an excellent source of quick-digesting carbs.
- Snacks : Your choices (paneer or chickpeas) are solid, providing protein and fiber.
- Dinner : Depending on what’s served, you can control your carb portions here.

Other Considerations:
- Strength Programs : Powerlifting programs are ideal for maintaining strength, so continue with those.
- Diet Coke/Coke Zero : These are fine in moderation, especially if they help digestion and curb cravings. However, ensure you’re getting enough water as well.

Your approach is mostly on track. Minor tweaks to protein, carb sources, and fats should help you achieve your goals while retaining strength.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1f9v9yc/suggestions_on_diet_for_weightloss/

2023-04-06 09:18:31,comment,all,," If you're looking for some fit foods to snack on while you're lifting, there are a few options that come to mind. Based on what you've already mentioned, it seems like you're already on the right track with Muscleblaze whey protein, Epigamia Greek yogurt, and skimmed milk.

In addition to those, you might want to consider adding some nuts and seeds to your snack list. Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are all great sources of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. They're perfect for snacking on between meals or adding to your protein shake.

Another option that you might want to try is roasted chickpeas. They're super easy to make at home, and they're a great snack that's high in protein and fiber. You can also buy pre-made roasted chickpeas if you're short on time.

If you're looking for a tasty protein bar with 20g of protein, Quest Bars, MusclePharm Combat Crunch, and BSN Syntha-6 Edge Protein Bars are all great options. They come in a variety of flavors, so you can choose the one that suits your taste buds the best.

And of course, boiled eggs are always a great source of protein. They're easy to make, and you can store them in the fridge for quick and easy snacking.

Last but not least, don't forget about fruits! Bananas, apples, oranges, and berries are all great options that are high in fiber and nutrients.",4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/12ddwwh/high_protein_low_calorie_food_options/

2020-05-30 16:13:25,submission,all,Try to help your local food brands,"I'm not saying we should boycott international goods because right now it's not practical, but what I am say is that, why not try out some indian start-up brands of food products or local great products. It doesn't have to be for everything but some small things. 

There are a ton of start up in the local space especially one brand I'm yet to try called Blue Tokai Coffee. They source everything and it seems like they directly connect the coffee growers to the customers. They seem a much better option for coffee lovers than Starbucks where their coffee is nothing but sugar syrup. Also a lot of them are in the health snack and granola bars business if that's your thing. Also there are a ton of ice cream places and food outlets on Zomato and Swigy. I don't think ordering dominoes or at Mc D once a while will harm anyone.

I'm practically surviving on indian brands food products right now with their frozen parathas and rotis and whatnot. I thought Amul choclate would be horrible but after I tried it, it's honestly better than most other chocolate out there. I hope Epigamia gets some love, their vanilla bean yogurt is amazing. 

The free markets give you the right to choose anything, but I guess we should also try things out once a while. I have had a micromax ""made in India"" phone and I swear it was shit, but also I have a samsung ""made in India"" TV and it's quite good. I don't know how well we will do this Atma Nirbharta thing but over the recent times I have shifted towards using Indian brands of guilty pleasure food because simply they make it better. Now if you think different it's fine, all I'm saying is that we should try it out before making our minds.

Bachelor from India living in Tier-1 City in Maharashtra with beginner level cooking skill here 👋

I need your help, I want to start eating Greek yogurt daily for health benefits (epigamia protein yogurt), but I just can't get used to the taste and smell of the plain, unsweetened kind. I actually like the flavoured versions, but most of them have added sugar and less protein.

I’m looking for easy, quick ways (preferably under 2 minutes) to improve the taste of plain Greek yogurt without making it unhealthy. No added sugar, and I’d like to keep the high protein content intact.

Any hacks, mix-ins, or go-to combos you use that make it more enjoyable which I can do daily as a vegetarian? Bonus if it doesn’t require a blender or a lot of prep!

ps- I found adding vanilla extract as easiest method, haven't tried it yet though. Thoughts?",0,44.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1lzizqd/how_do_you_make_plain_greek_yogurt_taste_better/

2026-02-07 16:31:54,submission,IndianFood,Is chicken tikka masala supposed to be floral/sweet?,"So this really is my first time cooking with a few spices, like garam masala, ground coriander, clove. I'm just trying to judge whether I got the flavor profile roughly down, because it was a very interesting but very good taste. I would call it sweet or floral, but I added no sugar. Also quite savory and spicy. I might try an Indian restaurant to compare, because it was just so different to what I expected.

My recipe was roughly (I eyeballed the spices):

\- 5 chicken thighs marinated with:  
\- yogurt  
\- black pepper  
\- salt  
\- ground coriander  
\- garam masala  
\- turmeric  
\- ground ginger (that's what I had)  
\- cumin powder  
\- chili powder  
\- garlic  
\- paprika  
\- forgot to add the lime

Sauce was:  
\- 4 cloves toasted in oil and chicken fond (never used them before, figured this was how to use them, pulled them out after a few minutes. I later realized 4 might be too much)  
\- 1 large onion  
\- 5 roma tomatoes  
\- garlic  
\- same spices as marinade  
\- blend  
\- heavy cream  
\- put chicken back in, simmer, serve with naan

I sorta just eyeballed it and was totally thrown off by the flavor, but I also liked it.",3,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1qyiata/is_chicken_tikka_masala_supposed_to_be_floralsweet/

2025-11-22 07:01:51,submission,IndianFood,Sabudana Khichadi: Traditional Indian Comfort Food Perfect for Fasting & Energy Boost,"Sabudana Khichadi is a classic Indian dish made with sago pearls (tapioca), peanuts, and mild spices, often eaten during fasting (vrat) days, but it’s also a light, wholesome meal any time.

Why it’s special:
	•	Easy to digest: Sago pearls are light on the stomach and perfect for sensitive digestion.
	•	Energy-rich: Packed with carbohydrates from tapioca and protein from peanuts, making it ideal for quick energy.
	•	Gluten-free & vegetarian: Naturally suitable for gluten-sensitive and vegetarian diets.
	•	Versatile: You can customize it with vegetables like carrots or peas, or add mild spices like cumin, green chilies, and curry leaves for flavor.

Cultural context:
	•	Popular in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and North India during fasting festivals like Navratri.
	•	Traditionally served as a breakfast, light dinner, or snack, often with yogurt or a squeeze of lemon for extra flavor.

Cooking tips:
	•	Soak sago pearls for 2–3 hours to get the right soft, chewy texture.
	•	Roast peanuts and spices separately for enhanced flavor.
	•	Avoid overcooking; the pearls should be soft but intact.

Bachelor from India living in Tier-1 City in Maharashtra with beginner level cooking skill here 👋

I need your help, I want to start eating Greek yogurt daily for health benefits (epigamia protein yogurt), but I just can't get used to the taste and smell of the plain, unsweetened kind. I actually like the flavoured versions, but most of them have added sugar and less protein.

I’m looking for easy, quick ways (preferably under 2 minutes) to improve the taste of plain Greek yogurt without making it unhealthy. No added sugar, and I’d like to keep the high protein content intact.

Any hacks, mix-ins, or go-to combos you use that make it more enjoyable which I can do daily as a vegetarian? Bonus if it doesn’t require a blender or a lot of prep!

2025-03-08 17:50:52,submission,IndianFood,what constitutes a full meal?,"Hi everyone,

I actually do not know much about Indian cuisine (it's not really available in my rural town) but I am now dating someone that is originally from India (he is from Maharashtra but mentions dishes from all over India as he has traveled a lot). He often says he misses good Indian food. I am a very good cook and generally cook everything from scratch.

Though it is new to me I am enjoying learning this cuisine. I.e. I now make masala chai every morning, and I've tried my hand at pav bhaji (including making the pav from scratch) and was told it was a little too spicy (for that particular dish) but generally good.

I found a recipe for Chicken Bhuna Masala that sounds tasty and I plan to make naan from scratch. However this recipe does not have any vegetables in it (unlike the pav bhaji) and in my Germanic family typically you would have a roasted veggie and/or a cold salad. but I don't know what would go with this Chicken Bhuna Masala.

I was considering making like a cucumber salad with a yogurt dressing I already have (not specifically Indian it's more middle eastern with citrus and sumac, but I could also add like some tadka to make it more Indian in flavor?). I don't have a big kitchen set up, my oven is broken so I just have a stovetop situation.

What would be required for a full meal and /or what should I pair with the chicken? Like maybe I can make a spinach dahl ahead of time? To heat up with the meal? Any advice is appreciated thank you.

UPDATE: Thank you to everyone! Because of some time constraints I am planning on having the menu be

Chicken Bhuna masala
Red lentil and spinach Dal
Koshumbir (I'm pretty sure I can find the right spices at our co op)
Cucumber raita
Fresh made garlic Naan

I found in our grocery store something advertised as a novelty ""microwave dinner"" ceramic plate that looks very similar to the all in one metal Thali I've seen online so I bought those. It has 3 small compartments and one larger one. Perfect for three sides and one main with a separate shared plate for the fresh naan. Everything but the chicken and naan can be made ahead of time so I'll do that and warm what needs warming before dinner ",27,47.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1j6mmgt/what_constitutes_a_full_meal/

2025-03-08 20:18:10,comment,IndianFood,,"This question is going to get some varied answers. 

Personally, my origins are Bengali, and for us (at least by my mum's rules), a ""full meal"" would be: 

* Rice/roti/bread of choice (this depends on what you're serving; both can be used as well) 
* A vegetarian starter (this can be a small ""curried"" dish) or daal 
* A main meal (may or may not be a meat dish), long as it's substantial) 
* Some onions and/or chilli on the side, fresh (a salad could substitute this, but are usually kept simple). A little pickle wouldn't go amiss, but we save that stuff for the evening
* A sweet to end with (we usually skip this ourselves) 

With all that in mind, you're not far off with your idea of doing a spinach daal. I wouldn't go with the salad unless you know it's going to work for him. And I'd forget the tadka in the salad, lol

Go with a small veg dish to start with/have alongside and you should be set. 

My mum's potatoes and beans recipe would be my go to, personally speaking. I'll drop a recipe once I'm back home (wrotten three versions of it out over the years and still not perfected it) in case you need it.

It’s usually a staple among rice or flatbread. The flatbreads can have variety - Naans are more fancy/outside eating type of option - on a daily basis it is a much simpler whole wheat based roti or chapati - or even a parantha for an indulgence (all have same dough, whole wheat flour - just the manner of preparation and the amount of fat - ghee or oil used to make them differs) 

A simple home meal cooked by mothers on a daily basis would be roti with 1-2 side dish - typically a vegetable curry or dry vegetable prep , and dal (pulses) and / or curd (yogurt) 

Some households eat non veg almost daily and some may eat it a couple of times a week. A dry or masala curry version can be the main dish with the roti/rice or even have a vegetable as an add on. 


Coming back to your question - a simple side salad can be kept, laccha onion is a simple go to for me - red onion cut in rings, added on with some Kashmiri red chilli (milder spice), or just plain salt with a sprinkle of lemon 


An add on if the dish is spicy is yogurt cucumber raita. 20% grated cucumber with 80% yogurt - whipped till creamy and some salt added

Here's a little secret about Indian food (and all food by proxy). Don't tell anyone I told you this. 

^(The ""right"" way to do things is whatever the people you're cooking for like.) 

I'm a little bit of a traditionalist in the sense that the base ingredients for a named dish should be kept to what they are, but thereafter: it really is your playground. 

The chicken should keep in the Dutch oven just fine. Pretty sure you've got that covered. Again: you're correct about the approach. Depending on the status of your oven, it can also be used as a ""heat trap"" to keep things in until you're good to go. If not, you can always reheat just before serving. 

Here's a [starter recipe](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cheap_Meals/comments/4uitjf/updated_recipe_my_mums_peppered_potato_and_beans/) for the beans and potatoes I mentioned earlier. It's not that close to the real dish, but should serve as a decent starting point.",5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1j6mmgt/what_constitutes_a_full_meal/

It may be a new idea which hasn’t struck him and he would like. You never know. Don’t get bogged down with what “should go together.” The beauty of cooking is that you can do what you like.

2025-03-02 19:40:52,submission,IndianFood,Veg biryani recipe?,"Ever since I became vegan, I have been trying to adapt biryani recipes to get the same flavor as I did before when I was cooking with meat and ghee. I know many people will say veg biryani is just pulao, but I don’t care to get into that argument right now so please refrain from commenting if that’s the only thing you can add. I have tried both biryani mixes as well as making biryani from scratch but have been unable to get the same flavor. Does anyone have a good recipe for a vegan biryani that either uses a biryani mix or just regular whole/ground spices? I have shan’s Bombay biryani mix, as well as Sindhi biryani mix. I have soya chunks that could be used to substitute meat. I have basmati rice, potatoes, tomatoes and everything else the recipe on the box asks for. I have coconut/cashew yogurt. I have vegan butter, regular oils like vegetable, canola, Olive, Coconut, and avocado oil. 

I moved away from South Asia and I miss biryani dearly and it reminds me of home. If someone has a recipe with quantities and directions, or just any other useful tips, I would forever thank you for enriching my life.

2024-12-28 13:50:24,submission,IndianFood,Stuck on getting biryani to match restaurants ,"As title says, I have been trying to make biryani but unable to achieve the same/similar flavor as what I've had in nearby/local restaurants. Specifically, I feel the rice is lacking flavor after mixing it all together and the chicken is just... feels like chicken slathered in some sauce if that makes sense? Lacking some of the distinct/strong flavor. Here is what I normally do:

1) Marinate chicken thighs (boneless) with ""Shan"" Biryani Masala Spice Mix + Whole Plain Yogurt + Ginger Paste + Garlic Paste + Lemon Juice + Fresh Mint + Fresh Cilantro + add some oil. I normally wait about an hour

2) Wash basmati rice a few times then let it soak for some 40 minutes.

3) Boil water with small amount of oil + bay leaf + cinnamon stick + Green cardamons + cloves, add rice once done boiling. Cook rice halfway

4) In big pot add chicken at the bottom, then layer rice over the chicken, add more mint and cilantro + french fried onions (bought at store), layer more rice and other things mentioned previously on top as well as some ghee.

5) Cover the pot with foil, cook on high heat for 5 minutes and then cook on low for 30 minutes. Mix at the end

Wondering if there is anything major that I am missing here. Not sure where I picked up this recipe I cannot find the link to it. 

I have seen some recipes online that cook onions then chicken and then add uncooked rice and a bunch of water and cook the rice on top of the chicken. The chicken tastes good in that pattern from what I tried before but the rice is awful... losing my mind trying to get something close to restaurant style. Not that what I make is inedible by any means but it hardly tastes the same. ",1,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ho614d/stuck_on_getting_biryani_to_match_restaurants/

I'm cubing my chicken thighs, marinating them in Greek yogurt, the recipe calls for butter, salt, ground ginger, chopped garlic, Garam masala, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, tomato sauce and cream. I'm *very* happy with this, but when thinking of ways to improve I had considered making my own Garam masala. Apart from being able to tweak it to be more heavy on certain flavors, how much of a difference would this make and how difficult/time consuming is it?

In r/cooking I was looking for other uses for Greek Yogurt and several people recommended some easy 2-3 ingredient Naan recipes utilizing Greek Yogurt, who has experience with this?

Lastly, my girlfriend and I both love onions, would it be really non traditional or possibly insulting(I cook a lot of Italian food and I know how serious Italians can be about their food and what ingredients do and don't belong in certain dishes) to add onion into my butter chicken while it's cooking?

If you love the way something tastes and if you feel like innovating, absolutely go for it. As an Indian myself and having grown up in this culture, I can tell you we love that someone is willing to not only try eating our food but cooking it too. That's what matters. Make what you love, cook with love and eat what you love.

We love fusion. We love experimentation. Putting things together that aren't normally put together - it's all good. 

Of course, when some dishes are made with specific intent like for worship, or for healing, there's a lot of rules that come into the picture. Certain ingredients confer certain qualities and there's a lot of wisdom behind why certain recipes are the way they are.

2024-09-21 06:03:27,comment,IndianFood,,"I can only add to this thread my cooking recommendations around garam masala and onions.

For garam masala, using a whole spice mix (just the various seeds/spices) and toasting them off before grinding in a mortar and pestle is the way to go. 

As others have said, it’s a spice mix that varies and over time experimenting you will find which adds and which detracts which is why I love using the whole spice mixes, I can choose exactly how much of each element to add to the dish and it varies if I’m cooking a dry savory vs a curry with heavy gravy or a dessert. 

On a side note: mortar and pestles are the best! 
My ancestors cooked this way and I do too. 
They’re amazing for making ginger/garlic/chili pastes too. 

For the onions, try onion pakoras or bhaji. They’re my version of Indian onion rings but not a ring. Cut and let sit in besan (chickpea/gram flour) for a half hour, they will naturally sweat and bind with the flour. Hand form them into unruly patties and deep fry. Serve with coriander mint chutney and tamarind chutney and it’s a top tier appetizer.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1fl3qou/making_your_own_garam_masalaalso_naan/

If you like onions, add them. I guarantee that every Indian family - as well as every Italian family - has their own variant on classic traditional dishes. 

Garam masala is easy but somewhat time consuming to make. To get the full flavour, you need to gently and slowly toast each component in a dry pan before mixing and grinding. Because they each need different amount of time to become fragrant, they need to be done individually. At least, that’s my family method.

2024-09-20 12:46:30,comment,IndianFood,,"To your original question, making your own garam masala from scratch will make a dramatic difference in indian dishes. Probably not so much in a recipe like butter chicken, because the masala play a minor role here. I would say do it and see for yourself, since its just tastier that way. Also experiment with other Indian dishes.  In indian cooking making your own masalas and powders (chilli, coriander, turmeric) is considered next level, so do it if you can and impress yourself and the guests. 


Also, do you use whole spices in your butter chicken? Sauteeing whole spices in the beginning is a great way to improve flavor.


Garam masala is easy to make, essentially roasting the spices on low heat and then grinning them to a fine powder, you're gonna need a decent grinder for it. Or I presume a coffee grinder would work.


Also, yes yogurt can be used in Naan, it helps in letting the flour rise a bit and give it the sourness similar to a well rested dough. If you make Naan, I suggest topping with chopped garlic and cilantro and brushing with lots of butter.


I would personally only add the onions while making the onion tomato paste, but nothing after that. Raw onions onto the curry is not traditional if that's what you meant.",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1fl3qou/making_your_own_garam_masalaalso_naan/

Shahi garam masala is what you will find in most Indian stores. Along with the above 3 ingredients, it has nutmeg, mace, bay leaves, whole peppercorns and dried red chillies. This has a more smokey flavour, used in Indian but non bengali dishes.

""The bustling street food stall is set up on a busy sidewalk in a vibrant, colorful North Indian city. A weathered wooden cart, painted in bright hues of red and yellow, serves as the central hub. Crisscrossing wires above, strung with festive lanterns, add a pop of light against the urban backdrop.

Sizzling sounds emanate from a compact, two-burner stove where spongy, crispy parathas are being cooked to perfection, their layers puffing up as they transform from doughy disks to golden brown, flaky masterpieces. Beside it, a metal pan holds simmering, aromatic chickpea curry, its thick consistency coating the surface like a warm hug.

Wedges of fresh, juicy jalebi, drizzled with syrup, gleam under glass cloches, awaiting eager customers. Lagan ki chaat, a popular street snack, forms an eye-catching pyramid - layers of crispy fried bread, boiled potatoes, onions, and yogurt, garnished with coriander leaves and a sprinkle of cumin powder. Glass bottles filled with cold lassi, a yogurt-based drink, sit at the ready for quenching thirst.

A chalkboard sign proclaims the menu in bold, black ink: Parathas (5 rupees), Jalebis (10 rupees), Chaat (15 rupees), and Lassis (20 rupees). The stall owner, a jovial man with a white dhoti and turban, serves patrons with a smile, deftly managing multiple orders while maintaining his signature charisma.

As evening descends, the aroma of roasting churis (savory street pretzels) wafts through the air, further enticing passersby to stop and indulge in this delectable symphony of North Indian flavors presented so lovingly by this quintessential street food vendor.""

Churis (also spelled as Churi or Churiyan) are a popular Indian snack food, especially in North India and Pakistan. They are essentially crispy, flavorful fried dough strips or fried breadsticks, often served as a side dish or used as a topping for various dishes like chaat items, salads, or soups.

Churis are typically made from a mixture of wheat flour, water, and spices, shaped into long, thin strips, and then deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. They can be seasoned with a variety of spices and herbs, such as cumin seeds, coriander seeds, chili powder, or garam masala, to give them a savory flavor.

Churis are often served with a variety of dips or chutneys, like tamarind chutney or mint chutney, to add an extra layer of flavor. They're a crunchy, addictive snack that's widely enjoyed in Indian cuisine!",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1es6x7e/well_ive_never_had_a_churi/

2024-06-09 21:48:59,submission,IndianFood,What ingredients do I reduce to lower the spice level of this chicken tikka dish?,"Hello, I have a chicken tikka recipe that my family loves but for some it is just a touch too spicy in terms of heat.  I would like to lower the heat by about 33%.  Per pound of chicken the recipe calls for the following spices to be added to the yogurt marinade:

1.5 tablespoon tandoori masala (I am using [this brand](https://www.amazon.com/Shan-Tandoori-Masala-Recipe-Seasoning/dp/B07YRYC8ZX))

2 teaspoons chaat masala (I am using [this brand](https://www.amazon.com/MDH-Chunky-Chat-Masala-3-5oz/dp/B005HSOWK4))

2 teaspoon kashmiri red pepper

1 teaspoon red chili powder

What do I reduce to lower the heat?

Thank you!

Update #1: Reducing the red chili pepper by 75% made a noticeable reduction in heat level without affecting the flavor.  Those in the family that enjoy spicy food considered it spicy enough, and those that have a lower tolerance felt it was at the upper limit of what they could tolerate.  If you are used to an American restaurant that has a 5 point heat scale of 1 being mild and 5 being the hottest, this change brought it down from a 3 to a 2.  To the two commenters who talked about reducing the tandoori masala, the brand I used did have chili powder high up in the ingredient list so this likely would have the same effect on the heat, but I probably won't try it because we like the flavor so much.",0,14.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1dc59be/what_ingredients_do_i_reduce_to_lower_the_spice/

* Wet:

* 30g butter                                       5%  

Dry:
* 14g salt                                          2.5%
* 25g sugar                                       4.5% 
* 560g all purpose                          100%                              
* 7-13g yeast                                     1.8% 

Form ball and knead for only 2 minutes. Will look like there is no gluten, that’s good. Bulk for 30min-2 hours doesn’t really matter, ball into 80-100g portions. Rise until noticeably puffed, roll and cook on a very hot dry pan. Should bubble up nicely on the first side, than those bubbles will become the dark spots when you flip. Any point the dough can be paused in the fridge for a few days. 

Microplane a few cloves of garlic in some butter or ghee and gently cook than brush on naan. Can use regular or the garlic butter in dough. Optionally also microplane a few cloves right into the dough. Fresh garlic or cooked/roasted is ok but garlic powder isn’t ok in the dough.

I'm half Telugu American and felt very disconnected from my culture until very recently, and one of the biggest things that helped me feel like I was reconnecting with my heritage was learning to cook Indian and South Asian food.

When I visited Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, including Hyderabad's Old City, for the first time, I had authentic Hyderabadi biryani and fell in love. Biryani has been one of my two favorite dishes for a long time. Recently I finally learned to cook it by myself, and I want to learn how to cook multiple variations. What are some regional biryani types both in and outside of South Asia, especially less known versions, and their defining characteristics, ingredients, and spices that set them apart?

Here's all the types of biryani I could find online (Some stuff may be incorrect, if there's anything I got wrong let me know):

- Nasi briyani (Singapore + Malaysia) - usage of Southeast Asian spices like pandan leaf, higher amount of gravy compared to South Asian biryanis

- Iraqi biryani - Sometimes uses vermicelli pasta alongside the rice, uses typical Arabic spices, uses spicy tomato sauce

- Kolkata biryani - Lightly spiced, notable for addition of potato and egg

- Nasing biringyi (Filipino biryani) - Rice is cooked with coconut milk and saffron, heavy usage of vegetables such as bell pepper, peas, and carrots, sometimes wrapped in banana leaf

- Sindhi biryani - Uses tomatoes and potatoes, quite spicy

- Memoni and Kutchi biryani - Very spicy, similar to Sindhi biryani but with less tomato

- Haji biryani (old city of Dhaka) - goat meat, potatoes, uses small amount of buffalo cheese, heavily seasoned but not very spicy. Often accompanied by borhani (Bengali drink of mint, yogurt, and spices)

- Ambur biryani (Northeast Tamil Nadu) - Larger proportion of meat, cooked with jeera samba rice, curd is used in the curry/gravy base, less spicy and lighter, served with sour brinjal curry. The onions in the biryani stay soft instead of being crispy.

- Somali biryani - Uses same ingredients as the Somali rice dish bariis iskukaris but cooked in the biryani style. Uses the Somali spice mixture xawaash, uses unique meats such as camel meat, served with banana or plantain on the side as is typical with Somali meals.

- Thalassery biryani (North Kerala) - Small amount of chilis, heavy usage of spices and dried fruits and nuts such as pomegranate, apricot, raisins, cashews, and almonds. Cooked with short grain khyma rice and uses chicken or beef as the meat.

- Kalyani biryani (Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana) - similar to Hyderabadi biryani, always cooked with buffalo meat

- Hyderabadi biryani - Most famous biryani type, from Old City of Hyderabad. Very spicy, lots of spices and dried fruits, usually goat meat EDIT: i have been informed that hyderabadi biryani does not use any dried fruits other than raisins/sultanas i think

- Shayya biryani (Uttara Kannada) - most notable for using vermicelli noodles instead of rice. Not very spicy.

- Kappa ""biryani"" (Kerala) - Very thick with lots of curry and gravy, doesn't use rice apparently. Made with beef and tapioca/cassava.

- Bombay biryani - Most notable for usage of plums. Not very spicy

- Patra ""biryani"" - Originates from Parsi community. No rice, is beef and spices cooked in patrel/colocassia leaves.

- Lucknowi biryani - Lightly spiced, flavorful

- Kashmiri biryani - Heavy on nuts and fruits, uses asafoetida and saffron, uses mutton

- Kamrupi biryani (Assam) - Uses vegetables such as beans, potato, and bell pepper that aren't used often in other types of biryani

- Goan biryani - Uses mackerel fish, grated coconut, very light and aromatic

- Bezawada biryani (Andhra Pradesh) - Uses fried chicken

- Gongura biryani (Andhra Pradesh) - Uses gongura (leaf used often in Telugu cuisine), gives it a distinctive sour flavor along with the spices.

- Thai biryani/kao mok gai - Uses a sour green sauce prepared with green chilies, mint, and coriander

- South African Cape Malay biryani - Similar preparation and spices to South Indian biryanis, but dal/lentils are incorporated as an ingredient.

These are all the regional types I could find. Aside from regional variations, there's also a lot of variations on ingredients used i.e. Chicken 65 biryani, paneer biryani, vegetable biryani, seafood biryani, etc.

2024-05-03 11:08:14,comment,IndianFood,,"Calling both lucknow and kolkata biryani lightly spiced is oversimplification, lucknow is lighter than hyderabadi and kolkata is an even lighter version of lucknow.

  
A very important thing to note here is that lucknow biryani is not just lighter it needs to have the following characteristics:

1. It should be clean i.e. the final product should just have meat and rice nothing else on the plate, the whole spices are used in a muslin bag and taken out before serving

2. its fragrance based, make sure to use authentic lucknowi kewra, something like this [https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/kewra-meetha-attar-2850017088191.html](https://m.indiamart.com/proddetail/kewra-meetha-attar-2850017088191.html)  none of the fake amazon crap

3. use milk in the yakhni (lucknow biryani is technically a yakhni pulao we just call it biryani), it rounds out the flavours of the spices and makes it more wholesome

Thalassery biriyani is not spicy at all. Its actually very mild compared to hyderabadi biriyani or tamil style biriyani. Its actually more aromatic than spicy.

Also, no dry fruits are used other than cashews and raisins fried in ghee for garnishing. No pomegranates or apricots at all.

Its served with raita, lemon or beetroot and dates pickle, and coconut and curd/ lemon chammanti ( dry chutney ).

Aleesa/Alsa with sugar is served before biriyani, especially for Muslim weddings. Its a wheat, mutton and coconut milk dish.

2024-04-01 06:10:47,submission,IndianFood,role of yogurt marinades,"Non-Indian here.  I run into a fair number of Indian recipes, for chicken especially, that involve yogurt marinades.  However, modern food science seems to be pretty skeptical about marinades - or at least, skeptical that marinades do much to tenderize meat or infuse it with flavor (e.g. [https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/marinades-and-brinerades/science-of-marinades-and-brinerades/](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/marinades-and-brinerades/science-of-marinades-and-brinerades/)).

So I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts on the role of yogurt marinades in Indian cuisine.  I'm not sure whether it's traditional or a modern/Western thing, nor whether yogurt tenderizes or infuses any better than other marinades.  It does seem, in some of the recipes, like the marinade might be intended to form a bit of a crust around the chicken, but the recipes rarely emphasize that.

2024-02-23 14:02:10,submission,IndianFood,Adding moisture to simple dishes,"*So I should open with 2 important details. I have a lot of food restrictions. I also am not Desi/Indian nor was I raised on Indian food. Indian foods & spices just tend to actually be very accommodating to my food restrictions. (I'm half certain I have ARFID eating disorder). So hopefully my post is close enough to on topic because it's hard for me to enjoy common denominator foods in US culture and I guess I just figured I'd get better advice here.*

Anyway one of the things I'm trying to do is increase the variety of protein in my meals. I can do this with cashews, seeds, different types of beans, spinach, peas, etc. And a way I find I enjoy doing this is just frying up vegetables in a wok (albeit not a high heat). It's simple, I can make a lot of food at once for leftovers. I can take my time seasoning it. I love the freeform nature of it.

My biggest issue is that I haven't figured out how to vary what kind of moisture content I add. Like to create a sauce. And this gets into where my restrictions are an issue.

*I don't enjoy most sauces or condiments I've heard of. Ketchup, mayo, ranch, bbq, mustard, basically any condiments associated with American food. I also can't do fish/seafood/meat, soy sauce, most smokey flavors, most vinegar based sauces.*

Condiments I love include salsas, hummus, coriander/mint chutney, and I have a chili sauce I like but I can't add too much (not enough to really change the texture of a dish anyway). 

When I'm doing freeform vegetable dishes like I mentioned above, I typically add tomatoes and tomato paste which break down nicely for adding moisture content. Yogurt makes it creamier and that's pretty great too. But apart from these two strategies I haven't come up with much for an alternative. And as I said it tends to mean my meals get repetitive.

Anyway if you have an ideas for something that might work for me based on the above info, I'd really appreciate the help. I'm finally learning how to cook healthy food I can enjoy within my limited scope. I just need to expand my options.

Do you eat eggs? If so, look up an egg curry recipe on YouTube. Most of them will use that classic onion-tomato gravy plus hard boiled eggs. If you don't eat eggs, maybe look for a rajma recipe. This is red kidney beans in an onion-tomato gravy. Or any basic chicken or mutton curry will also typically use that onion-tomato gravy.

Once you make the gravy a few times with eggs or beans, you can experiment with other veggies. It goes great with potatoes, yams, chickpeas, and pretty much any firm veggie. You can keep it more liquid or add less water (or reduce the water down) to get the consistency you prefer. 

Since you're trying to get more protein, you can also use that same gravy to make kheema matar, but substitute soy crumbles (soaked to soften, then squeezed to leave a spongy crumble that will absorb the sauce nicely) instead of the ground meat.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ay1611/adding_moisture_to_simple_dishes/

You can use raw onions blended.
Chopped up onions ....sliced onions....
Caramelized onions...

Each has it's own flavour. Most gravy have onions...ginger garlic paste...blended tomatoes and spices as the base",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ay1611/adding_moisture_to_simple_dishes/
2024-03-08 18:53:50,comment,IndianFood,,"Cooking method can also give you less or more moisture. High flame, quick cook is great for crisper veg. Medium flame with a lid will give you more liquid. Hack- use a plate as a lid and put some water in the plate. It will prevent whatever you're cooking from drying out and sticking to the pan, while also not watering down your actual meal content. You may or may not enjoy this- but I also pressure cook a lot of my veggies because it's fast and i find the texture of it comforting. But it's not everyone's cup of tea or strictly traditional. Just how my mom used to make it for me. Some easy recipes: throw some green beans, cubed potatoes, cubed tomatoes, salt, pinch of turmeric and cumin powder in a pressure cooker. Pressure cook for one whistle. Open and enjoy. You can change the beans for spinach and it works well with those frozen spinach cube things.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ay1611/adding_moisture_to_simple_dishes/

2023-12-07 23:40:09,submission,IndianFood,What made my chicken korma taste so bad ?,"I bought Shan Korma Masala mix yesterday and today made Chicken Korma with it. The raw masala smelled divine when I opened the packet - with perfumy undertone of kewda.

1) I fried 2 very large red onions to golden brown and rest it to cool.

2) I put 200 ml of oil in instantpot with 2 lb of chicken thighs medium chopped pieces with some freshly grated ginger garlic paste (1.5 tbsp).

3) In blender, I put the cooled golden brown onion which were crispy and crunchy now - along with a handful of blanched Almonds - and 1.5 cups of Chobani Fat Free Greek Yogurt. I blended everything into a fine smooth paste with water.

4) After searing the chicken thigh pieces in oil with ginger garlic paste and red chilli powder, I tossed in the entire packet of Shan Korma mix and the blended paste.

5) I cooked on high pressure setting on InstantPot for 6 mins.

When I opened instantpot, I saw oil had separated and chicken had cooked perfectly. The korma looked divine - just like the way I see photos of it online, bright, orange-reddish color with oil separated on the sides.

Taste : Confusing taste of strong fried onion undertone with taste of almond paste, and some sort of ""gravy"" which did not taste pleasant.
It was edible, but it was not a pleasant taste. It was not inedible but did not taste good.

Somehow the dish tasted incomplete compared to any other Indian curry I've had. As though there's no acidity to it, no tomatoes and no good flavor of masalas.

Also one more thing is that many recipes on youtube suggested to use the same oil that I deep fried onions with in the korma for better flavor which I did follow - however I found when tasting the dish the canola oil had a ""deep fried flavor"" to it which was also not pleasant.

I probably should have used ghee but was trying to save on saturated fat.

Had to toss the entire thing out. Is this how authentic korma is supposed to taste ? Or did I mess up ?",9,53.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/18d9232/what_made_my_chicken_korma_taste_so_bad/

2023-12-08 10:56:17,comment,IndianFood,," You  want to saute the spice paste before the slow cooking process as sauting will bring out flavor. Also saute the aromatics (garlic and ginger) before adding in the chicken. Definitely, do not pressure cook it and needs slow simmering it. Add in the yogurt after sauting the spice paste. Yogurt splits at high temperatures and high pressure, so avoid that.
Moreover  most Indian households will temper the korma after it is done cooking with an additional layer of spices. Mostly cumin, red chillies and some garlic tempered in ghee. It adds another layer of flavour. It's called a tadka.",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/18d9232/what_made_my_chicken_korma_taste_so_bad/

2023-12-08 17:39:27,comment,IndianFood,,"If the onions were not fully carmelized when he blended them, it will be very, very bitter. It's also possible your garlic and ginger burned if you cooked it with the chicken at a high heat. All of that is going to taste bad.

I also agree with the Instant Pot comment; I'm not sure why you would pressure cook this dish when you've already done most of the cooking by the time you cook the chicken. It only needs about another 20 minutes after the sear at a simmer and you are done. It probably would also reduce the sauce more and give it more time to develop.

Also, for Korma/Makhani you usually cook the meat in the sauce; there's no need to sear. It's not Chicken Tikka.

So to correct:

1. Cook onions until carmelized on medium-low. Add powdered spice mixture to onions. Cook for a minute or so. (If you really wanted to do this well, I'd add the spices and toast quickly for a minute first - also using whole spices - but that's more advanced)
2. Add ginger/garlic paste to the onions, not to the chicken. Cook until it no longer smells ""raw"".
3. After blending the mixture (WITHOUT yogurt), return to pan and simmer with chicken thighs
4. When thighs are done, stir in yogurt to taste",6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/18d9232/what_made_my_chicken_korma_taste_so_bad/

2023-10-02 13:21:24,submission,IndianFood,Ingredients and substitutes for Curry Lamb,"Lamb – I prefer to use a lamb shoulder or leg of lamb for this dish. The meat does take longer to cook, but it comes out tender and juicy and absorbs all those wonderful spices. You can use lamb stew meat. While you can use boneless lamb I like to leave a few bones in for flavor.  
Onions – I love to use red onions. They add a bit of sweetness, which is very desirable. And it is very important that you cook the onions longer and slower. This will help caramelize the onions, which not just enhances the taste, but also adds that touch of deep red color to this dish (which I love).  
Garlic ginger – of course, you want to use fresh garlic cloves and fresh ginger for the best flavor with curry.  
Yogurt – Meat and dairy cooked together have a unique taste. In addition, yogurt also tenderizes the meat and makes it cook faster. And, it has a rich and creamy taste. If you can’t use yogurt you can use coconut milk or coconut cream too.  
Spices – There really is coriander, cumin, paprika, and cayenne, which you can find on any supermarket spice rack. But you can also use 4 tbsp of store-bought or homemade curry powder if you don’t have these on hand.  
Spice mix – The whole spices are used to perfume the dish. If you don’t have the whole spices you can use store-bought or homemade garam masala. Garam masala is a combination of warm spices like cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, cloves, etc..

2023-07-24 08:55:49,submission,IndianFood,Egg-Paneer Recipe,"#Indian-style Egg and Paneer

Ingredients:

For the Tadka (Tempering):

- 1 tablespoon ghee or oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 dried red chili (optional, for heat)
- A pinch of asafoetida (hing) powder
- 8-10 curry leaves

Additional Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnish
- 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) for a unique flavor (optional)
- 1/2 cup finely chopped spinach or kale for added nutrition and color (optional)
- 1/4 cup coconut milk or cream for creaminess (optional)
- 1 tablespoon tamarind paste or 1/2 tablespoon amchur (dried mango powder) for tanginess
- 1 teaspoon honey or brown sugar for a hint of sweetness
- 1 teaspoon garam masala or chaat masala for a burst of spice and flavor
- 1/4 cup grated coconut (fresh or desiccated) for an extra tropical touch

New Techniques:

1. **Marinating the Paneer**:
   - Before adding the grated paneer to the egg mixture, marinate it in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a pinch of garam masala. Allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes to absorb the flavors.

2. **Pan Roasting the Paneer**:
   - After marinating, lightly pan roast the marinated paneer cubes until they develop a golden-brown crust. This step will add depth to the paneer's flavor and texture.

Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, milk or cream, salt, chili powder, black pepper powder, Schezwan sauce, chopped coriander leaves, a pinch of turmeric powder, lemon juice or vinegar, grated ginger, ground coriander, and ground cumin together until well combined.

2. Add the grated onions, minced garlic, finely chopped spinach or kale, lightly sautéed mixed vegetables, and pan-roasted marinated paneer to the egg mixture. Stir to combine.

3. Grease an oven-safe baking dish or microwave-safe bowl and pour the egg mixture into it.

4. Sprinkle the chopped tomatoes and green chilies over the egg mixture.

5. In a small saucepan or tadka pan, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat.

6. Add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds to the hot ghee or oil. Let them sizzle and crackle for a few seconds.

7. If using dried red chili, break it into halves and add it to the pan along with a pinch of asafoetida (hing) powder.

8. Now, add the curry leaves to the pan and let them splutter for a couple of seconds.

9. Quickly pour the prepared tadka over the egg mixture in the baking dish. The tadka will infuse the dish with wonderful Indian flavors.

10. Sprinkle kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) over the top for a unique and aromatic touch (optional).

11. Drizzle tamarind paste or amchur (dried mango powder) over the dish for tanginess.

12. Add honey or brown sugar for a hint of sweetness, balancing the flavors.

13. Microwave the dish for about four minutes or until the eggs are fully cooked and fluffy.

14. Once done, remove the dish from the microwave and let it cool slightly.

15. Garnish the dish with grated coconut for an extra tropical touch and chopped cilantro for added freshness and appeal.

16. Optionally, drizzle coconut milk or cream over the top of the dish for extra creaminess.

17. Sprinkle garam masala or chaat masala over the dish for a burst of spice and flavor.

18. Serve your exceptionally delicious and flavor-packed Indian-style egg and paneer dish with some toasted bread or roti for a satisfying and fulfilling meal.",2,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1584zut/eggpaneer_recipe/

2023-07-20 19:10:43,submission,IndianFood,5 things I learned from testing 100 Chicken Tikka marinades,"Ok maybe not 100 but I did eat way too much chicken.  I wanted to test what ingredients and techniques made the best chicken tikka marinade and really dig into what a marinade is supposed to do.  TLDR; If you would rather watch the video than read this summary you can check it out [here](https://youtu.be/g-_6nDRsHGU)  First, let’s do some background.  
**What is a marinade?**    
A marinade consists of flavor, acids, and fats.  Flavor flavors the food but some ingredients in chicken tikka, like ginger, do a little extra credit.  Acid adds a little flavor but more importantly breaks down the surface proteins of the chicken.  This tenderizes the surface of the chicken and creates more surface area for the flavor to penetrate.  Fat gathers up all the flavor and sticks it onto the surface of the meat.  It is important to note, MARINADES DO NOT PENETRATE PAST THE SURACE OF THE MEAT.  A marinades job is to take flavor and stick it to the outside of the meat.  The longer you marinate the more concentrated the flavor will be on the surface of the meat.  
**What is a Chicken Tikka marinade?**  
A Chicken Tikka marinade can be as simple as yogurt and spices but if you search around you will usually come across a two part marinade:  
Chicken pieces, salt, lemon, ginger, garlic  
Let sit for 30-90 minutes and then drain  
Then add the spice mix, yogurt, oil  
**Things I learned:**  
1. **Marinades only stick to the outside of the meat.**  I know I addressed it earlier but it’s important to know.  Marinades do not penetrate past the first 3 or so mm of surface.  Acid breaks down the surface to create more surface area and fat takes all the flavor and sticks it onto the surface.    
2. **Salting early is everything.**  Go get two slices of tomato.  Salt one.  Let them sit for 45 min.  Then salt the other one.  Taste them both.  It is wild what salt can do when it sits.  This is an example of it penetrating and flavoring over time but in chicken is also dissolves protein stands into a gel, which allows them to absorb and retain water better as they cook.   
3. If I’m marinating for over 5 hours, I’m going to **skip the lemon in the first marinade**.  Both Ginger and yogurt denature surface proteins.  If I was going to marinade past 5 hours, I didn’t need any additional acid in my marinade to do additional denaturing.  I did, however, like adding a little rice wine vinegar 30 minutes before grilling for flavor.  In my next video I go over basting and for me this is where acid shines but we will save that for the next post.     
Note 1: Acid didn’t not break down skin side pieces as much as cut pieces so If I was dealing with whole pieces of chicken an acid bath would make more sense.  Restaurants use a tandoori oven which has the ability to crisp up the soft surface of chicken whereas my grill or an oven does not.    
Note 2: I recognize an acid bath is also meant for cleaning.  My chicken here in Mexico is pretty good a rests a few days before it gets to me so I didn’t need that additional acid bath.  I would use it if I had a freshly killed chicken or a really smelly gamey one.  
4. **If you are short on time forget using yogurt.**  Yogurt is a lactic acid which is much more gentle than citric(citrus) or acetic (vinegar) acids and needs at least 5 hours to start doing its thing.  If I only have 2 hours before grilling, I’m going to use a citric or acetic acid early in the marinade and switch out the fat.  My two favorite substitutes were mayonnaise and cream.  
5. This is a bonus tip that will be in the next video but it isn’t going to drop for a while so I figured I would give it to you now.  **Wipe the marinade off of your chicken.**  I used a salad spinner to get most of it off and then dabbed it with a paper towel to get rid of all the surface moisture right before grilling.  This makes the best chicken tikka.  I’ll explain why in the next post.  
Hope you learned something new.  Let me know if you disagree with anything I laid out or having anything to add. I’m interested to hear your takes.

>A marinades job is to take flavor and stick it to the outside of the meat.

This, for example, ignores the crucial role marinades play in tenderizing.  Marinades may tenderize via multiple avenues, including both chemical (like an acid) and many enzymatic means.  Pop science outlets use high-school experiments to demonstrate the effects of chemical tenderization, and it's interesting.  But the topic is complicated, and rigorous food science hasn't actually reached definitive results on how all the different avenues of tenderization work.  Given that in Indian foods, the tenderness of meat is amongst its *most* prized qualities, this is a real omission.  In my own informal experience, meats are certainly tenderized beyond a depth of a few millimetres by yogurt (enzymatically?  by secondary effects from bacteria?); I would think anyone eating a thick tikka in Old Delhi could immediately recognize that.  The meat is quite soft, all the way in the middle, which of course using something like mayonnaise won't achieve.",15,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/155068u/5_things_i_learned_from_testing_100_chicken_tikka/

Sloppy marinades are a home cook thing; authentic tikka and tandoori marinades use what we call latka hua dahi or tanga hua dahi which is literally yogurt dumped into a muslin cloth/cheesecloth and hung ideally overnight or for a couple of hours to extract all the water out. This creates an incredibly dry yogurt which will sop up any liquid fast - including the mustard oil we use in marinades and juices the chicken oozes out during cooking.",17,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/155068u/5_things_i_learned_from_testing_100_chicken_tikka/

I just thought the premise would be more genuine/heartfelt if you started with investigating WHY have chefs been making it in a certain way and deconstruct it from there. For those of us who knew about it, the implied climax seemed like a yea duh moment. 

There's a reason why dishes are cooked a certain way. Let's dive into those instead of arriving at the conclusion through rounds of ""experimentation"" and deductive reasoning.

Jacques Pepin is a fantastic educator explains why he makes classic french omelet a certain way and just shows you while he's doing it. He doesn't have 5 trays beaten egg yolk (and whisks and pans lying around as proof of his rounds and rounds of efforts) to arrive at the perfect omelet.

But, the real agent here to create a classically soft tikka in India is yogurt (and papain).  I really don't think this should be very surprising or controversial.  And, if you know what the character of this soft meat is, you will easily find that salt alone will not achieve it.  I'm not against a little homey science, but honestly the experiment has already been performed for a few centuries at least.  

Next we are to discover that tikkas shouldn't be cooked to 74 degrees?  LOL.  Wait until OP finds out this is absolutely done by the most highly-regarded Moghlai chefs routinely ... even more than once to many types of skewer.  And yes, with excellent results.  The meat is not dry due to its marinade (in curd) and displays not only flavor, but more importantly its prized textural quality.

To be clear, there's nothing wrong with innovating, adapting, experimenting, creating.  If it makes something tasty that people enjoy, I'm all for it.  I just think these particular departures are missing the mark and failing to capture the excellent standard already established by the Babu Bhais of the world.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/155068u/5_things_i_learned_from_testing_100_chicken_tikka/

Take the viewer on a ride with me to see the mistakes and see what works best for me in my home.  I realize I may have missed the mark on that recently by going the ""report"" route rather than the ""story"" route.  I've made a bunch of yogurt based marinades in the past and I just don't like them.  I like restaurants and street food stalls.  But mine has never really been that good.  Why?  That's the journey I wanted to take and in the interest of keeping things short and concise I tend to edit those story blocks out.  But a lot of this info is stuff I'm finding out for the first time.  It's my cooking journey to BECOME Jacques Pepin, not me pretending like I'm already there.  

I see a lot of chefs on YouTube or bloggers or cookbooks omit important techniques and I wanted to make a video that lays out a full blueprint of ingredients and techniques that allows each viewer to take pieces and use in their own cooking.  I'm not here trying to give you a recipe and calling it a day.  In fact I give that to you in the first 10 seconds of the video just to scratch that itch you may have and then I move on.  I'm trying to ask WHY.  What is x doing.  This recipe says 5 hours this say 15, which one do I do?  And why?  Shit I only have an hour before guests arrive, can I still make chicken tikka? Every one has strong opinions but not everyone explains why?  I do appreciate your feedback.  I think your second post was much more constructive and now I understand where you are coming from. I look forward to all constructive criticism and will keep it in mind as I move forward.  Especially in the next episode where you can find out how this ONE trick changed my life FOREVER!

Chicken Curry

Ingredients:

For the Marinade:

3lbs Deboned Chicken Thighs

1 cup plain yogurt

2 tablespoons garam masala

2 tablespoons salt

For the Curry Sauce:

To taste: Kosher salt

2 teaspoons: Ground coriander

2 teaspoons: Ground cumin

1/2 teaspoon: Ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon: Freshly grated nutmeg

1/2 teaspoon: Fenugreek seeds

4: Jalapeños, coarsely chopped with some seeds

2: Dried red chiles, broken

4: Shallots, coarsely chopped

8: Large garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 (3-inch) piece: Ginger, peeled and sliced crosswise into paper-thin rounds

32 oz: Canned peeled whole tomatoes

1 cup: Chopped cilantro

1/4 cup: Chicken stock

12 oz: Coconut milk

3 tablespoons: Ghee (2 tablespoons for cooking, 1 tablespoon for step 4)

2 tablespoons: Coconut oil

1/2 teaspoon: Whole cloves

1/2 teaspoon: Whole cumin seeds

1: Bay leaf

1 (2-inch) piece: Cinnamon stick

: Garam masala (for sprinkling)

Optional: Lemon or lime juice

2-3: Sweet potatoes, cut into chunks

2: Yellow bell peppers, cut into chunks

2: Orange bell peppers, cut into chunks

Directions:

In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of plain yogurt, 2 tablespoons of garam masala, and 2 tablespoons of salt. Mix well. Add the chicken to the marinade and coat it evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least three hours, allowing the chicken to marinate.

Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

Heat 3 tablespoons of ghee and 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat. Add the marinated chicken to the skillet. Cook the chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken pieces to a large bowl.

Deglaze the pan by adding the canned peeled whole tomatoes to the skillet. Break the tomatoes apart with a wooden spoon. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Remove the tomatoes from the skillet and transfer them to a food processor. Set aside.

In the same skillet, add the whole spices (1/2 teaspoon whole cloves, 1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seeds, 1 bay leaf, 1 (2-inch) piece of cinnamon stick, and 2 dried red chiles broken into pieces). Sauté the spices until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

Add 4 jalapeños, 4 shallots, 8 large garlic cloves, and 1 (3-inch) piece of sliced ginger to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the aromatics are fragrant and the shallots are translucent, about 5 minutes.

Spoon the cooked onion and spice mixture into the food processor with the tomatoes. Process until smooth and pureed.

In a large pot, combine the pureed onion, spice, and tomato mixture with 1 cup of chopped cilantro, 1/4 cup of chicken stock, and 12 Oz of coconut milk. Mix well.

Add the cooked chicken pieces to the pot along with any accumulated juices. Stir to combine.

Place the cheese cloth or spice bag containing the bay leaf and cinnamon stick into the pot with the curry. This will infuse the flavors into the sauce.

Cook the chicken curry over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together, about 15-20 minutes.

While the curry is cooking, spread the chunks of sweet potatoes, yellow bell peppers, and orange bell peppers on a baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly charred.

Once roasted, add the bell peppers and sweet potatoes to the pot with the chicken curry. Stir to combine. Cook over moderate heat for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

Season the curry with salt to taste. Sprinkle with garam masala for added flavor. If desired, add a squeeze of lemon or lime juice for a tangy kick.

Transfer the chicken curry to a serving dish. Garnish with additional cilantro leaves if desired. Serve hot with rice or naan bread.",2,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/151evne/chicken_curry_recipe_improvement/

2022-12-19 02:07:52,submission,IndianFood,What possibly did I miss from this recipe?,"I made butter chicken for the first time using this recipe (an exact copy of the recipe from the cookbook):

Ingredients:

1 ¼ lbs skinless boneless chicken breast, cut into 1 in cubes

Marinade:

1/4 cup plain Yogurt

1 teaspoon red Kashmiri chile powder

1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste

2 tablespoons lemon juice

½ teaspoon garam masala

Salt

Makhani sauce:

2 tablespoons salted butter

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

½ teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi), plus extra to serve

1 fresh green chile, finely chopped

1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste

3/4 cup tomato paste

1/2 teaspoon garam masala

2 tablespoons honey

3 ounces cream, plus extras to serve

Steps:

1 - Combine marinade ingredients into a bowl and add the cubed chicken. Cover and let marinade in the fridge for at least 1 hour, preferrably overnight

2 - Preheat the oven to 400F. Transfer marinade and chicken to an ovenproof dish and bake for 10-15 mins until tender and cooked through

3 - For the Makhani sauce, heat the butter and oil over high heat and add the kasoori methi and green chile. Stir in ginger-garlic paste, cook for a minute or so, then add tomato paste and stir to blend for a couple of minutes.

4 - Mix in the chile powder, garam masala, and honey, and season with salt. Finish with the cream, them add enough water to give the sauce a pouring consistency

5 - Add the cooked chicken to the sauce. Serve with rice or Laccha Paratha, with a swirl of cream and a sprinkling of kasoori methi.


It was delicious, and I followed it as exactly as I could. I got all the right spices like the chile spice and not just using whatever I had. The only exception is I used some thai peppers instead of a green chile, and I didn't realize I needed to make ginger-garlic paste and just kinda mashed them together since my food processor is broken. I portioned everything out before mixing to make sure I wouldn't burn anything under time pressure. I only marinated it for the hour also.

It tasted amazing, bit it felt like something was missing compared to the butter chicken I've had at my local indian food restaurant. Maybe it just needed more butter or salt or cream compared to a restaurant, but it felt like I was missing an entire pillar of flavor. It was great regardless but I'm wondering if there's some obvious ingredient that would make sense to have that kind of impact",8,16.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zpezoo/what_possibly_did_i_miss_from_this_recipe/

Marinate overnight. Don't listen to people who are saying you need to use thighs. You can use breast meat.

Don't cook in the oven. Use a heavy bottomed skillet. The best option is to pressure cook but you need some practice to be sure you won't overcook your chicken.

I'll definitely add onions next time. The chicken breast was actually very good, I used a thermometer to make sure I didn't overcook them. I'd probably use either thighs or breasts depending on what I have at the time.

I don't have a pressure cooker so I don't mind trying a  pan next time.

2022-11-27 23:58:36,submission,IndianFood,Super easy BIR dairy free chicken Korma,"I have been experimenting with korma recipes the last 2 months and I finally have it down to where it’s better than most Indian restaurants in my area. 

My biggest mistake was using too many spices and too much of them.  Garam masala would overpower this dish and IMO took away from what korma should taste like.  

Marinate 1lb chicken thighs by making a marinade of 3 TBSP almond yogurt and 1tsp  turmeric and 1 tsp cumin.


Boil 3/4 cup cashews for 20-30 minutes in a small saucepan

In a separate pan, Cook 2 chopped onions in 3 tbsp ghee/oil on high heat while adding 3-4 garlic cloves and a teaspoon of fresh ginger. 

Add a tablespoon of salt as this will bring out the flavors of the garlic

Add 3 cardamon pods after cooking the onion mixture for 10 minutes.

Once the onions are caramelized, add in 1/3 cup of tomato purée and cook for another 5 minutes. 

After this is done cooking, remove the cashews from heat.  Also remove the onion mixture from heat.  

Allow both to cool down.  

Combine cashews, onion mixture and 1 cup of water and blend with a hand blender or food processor for about 2 minutes until you have a smooth paste.

In the same pan where you cooked your onions, add 2 TBSP ghee/oil and cook your marinated chicken thighs on medium heat.  Once cooked, use a sieve, pour in your onion cashew mixture.  

Add 2tsp salt and 1/2 tsp hot chili powder or more for heat.

Add enough water to the pan so that your gravy is slightly watery, the water will cook out and the gravy will thicken up.

Take 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves and crush them by rubbing them in your hands and sprinkling into your gravy.

Continue to cook until you reach your desired korma thickness.",5,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/z6gxzp/super_easy_bir_dairy_free_chicken_korma/

2022-09-30 12:25:21,submission,IndianFood,"Sharing family recipes (Bhuna Ghost, Karahi, Daal, etc) 2.0","Two years ago when the covid shutdown took place, our friends and family were desperately trying to learn to cook at home. My wife and I started a food blog as a means of storing and sharing family recipes. These are meals we prepare at least a few times a month at home. We are a multi-generational family that lives together, so these recipes have been tested to work for opinionated grandfathers and picky kids alike. Our introductory post here two years ago was well received and I wanted to share an updated one. 

Our family has primarily lived in Bihar, UP, and Karachi (Pakistan) so those are the influences on our cooking. Please let us know if you have any questions or recipe requests! We love researching and preparing authentic recipes to share with those we love.

**North Indian Garam Masala (**[https://jamilghar.com/garam-masala-recipe/](https://jamilghar.com/garam-masala-recipe/)**)**

Our North Indian garam masala recipe is a family treasure my mother-in-law gave me permission to share. Like most recipes, it was passed down through the generations. Her mother learned how to prepare it from her grandmother, who then shared it with my mother-in-law and her sisters. And now I have the honor of sharing it with all of you. 

**Bhuna Gosht – Dry Goat Fry (**[https://jamilghar.com/bhuna-gosht/](https://jamilghar.com/bhuna-gosht/)**)**

Enjoy our dry bhuna gosht fry made with mutton or lamb and slow-cooked in whole spices; the gosht later fries in onion, garlic, and ginger, resulting in a highly concentrated and flavorful meal you will crave. This, aloo keema, and our karahi are two of our favorite meat-based meals!

**Aloo Keema – Ground Beef with Potatoes (**[https://jamilghar.com/aloo\_keema/](https://jamilghar.com/aloo_keema/)**)**

Our one-pot, homestyle aloo keema is made with seasoned ground beef and potatoes sautéed in tomato, onion, garlic, ginger, and warm spices. We serve ours with naan, roti, or [**basmati rice**](https://jamilghar.com/basmati-rice/).

**Pakistani Karahi Gosht – Goat Tomato Curry (**[https://jamilghar.com/gosht-karahi/](https://jamilghar.com/gosht-karahi/)**)**

Pakistani karahi gosht draws its flavor from a thick, tomato-based curry made with fresh tomatoes, lots of fresh ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Karahi Gosht is well-known in Pakistan and India because of its popularity in restaurants and dhabas. While modern recipes tend to include onion or yogurt, we stick to the basics with our take on a Pakistani classic. My father liked this meal so much he was all but licking his plate the first time I served it! 

**Grilled Tandoori Chicken (**[https://jamilghar.com/grilled\_tandoori\_chicken/](https://jamilghar.com/grilled_tandoori_chicken/)**)**

Grilled tandoori chicken is one of those meals you keep coming back to; the inside is moist while maintaining a nice char on the outside, and it has all the eye-catching color you’d expect from the dish. Ours is coated in a tandoori marinade and cooked on the grill to smoky perfection.

**Moong Dal (Instant Pot and Stovetop)** **(**[https://jamilghar.com/moong-dal/](https://jamilghar.com/moong-dal/)**)**

Growing up, I ate dal chawal (moong dal and basmati rice) almost every day for lunch and sometimes dinner when the temperature rose in Pakistan; he was not a fan! Isn’t it funny how everything changes when we become adults? Moong dal with rice is his most requested meal and reminds him of home.

**Instant Pot Masoor Dal (**[https://jamilghar.com/goa-masoor-dal/](https://jamilghar.com/goa-masoor-dal/)**)**

Fennel, coriander, turmeric, and mustard add flavor to our Instant Pot masoor dal. Lentils combine with creamy coconut, spinach, and lime juice for a protein-rich meal that’s ready and on your table in 30 minutes! We serve ours with vegetable pakora and [**basmati rice.**](https://jamilghar.com/basmati-rice/)

**Butter Chicken – Murgh Makhani (**[https://jamilghar.com/butter-chicken/](https://jamilghar.com/butter-chicken/)**)**

Make the creamiest butter chicken right at home. Tender pieces of chicken cook in a robust, fragrant, and creamy curry to make our easy and flavorful butter chicken recipe. This meal is the best way to use leftover grilled tandoori chicken, and we serve ours with naan and basmati rice. This is our 6-year-old's favorite dish. 

**Instant Pot Chicken Biryani (**[https://jamilghar.com/chicken\_biryani/](https://jamilghar.com/chicken_biryani/)**)**

Treat yourself to mouth-watering biryani without setting aside most of your day to make it; our quick Instant Pot chicken biryani cooks in one hour and combines chicken, long-grained basmati rice, caramelized onion, and warm spices!

**Beef Kaleji Recipe – Beef Liver Curry (**[https://jamilghar.com/beef-kaleji-recipe-beef-liver-curry/](https://jamilghar.com/beef-kaleji-recipe-beef-liver-curry/)**)**

This meal is perfect for events with family and friends like Bakra Eid; beef liver simmers in an onion, ginger, and garlic-flavored masala. Serve it as is or with fresh bread like paratha, naan, or roti. If you’re on the fence about liver, that’s okay; our kaleji masala fry is the most appetizing way to eat this nutrient-dense protein.

**Mutton Yakhni Soup – Bone Broth (**[https://jamilghar.com/goat-yakhni/](https://jamilghar.com/goat-yakhni/)**)**

Is bone broth still all the rave? If not, it should be! There is something ultra-soothing about a hot bowl of yakhni soup. Goat or beef cooks with onion, garlic, ginger, and whole spices to create a wonderfully warm and healthy broth that fills the entire room with deep aromatics.

**Chana Masala - Chickpea Curry (**[https://jamilghar.com/channa-masala/](https://jamilghar.com/channa-masala/)**)**

This chickpea recipe comes together with a flavorful tomato-based curry made from onions, fresh ginger, garlic, green chilies, and cilantro. Our restaurant-style chana masala comes together in 40 minutes, making it the perfect weeknight meal; it serves as a stand-alone meal or a tasty side dish. We serve ours with basmati rice ([https://jamilghar.com/basmati-rice/](https://jamilghar.com/basmati-rice/)), poori, and halwa.

**Carrot Halwa – Gajar Ka Halwa (**[https://jamilghar.com/carrot-halwa/](https://jamilghar.com/carrot-halwa/)**)**

Carrot halwa is a classic sweet dish made with milk, carrots, sugar, and ghee. Also called gajar ka halwa in Hindi, this is a traditional North Indian and Pakistani dessert that we prepare just like my dadi used to, slow-cooked to perfect. Like our [**sheer khurma**](https://jamilghar.com/sheer-khurma/)– this rich and delicious dessert has a sweet milky base, and we top it with toasted nuts. Enjoy it as is or with a scoop of ice cream for a tasty, indulgent treat. 

**Mango Lassi (**[https://jamilghar.com/mango-lassi/](https://jamilghar.com/mango-lassi/)**)**

This creamy drink is made from mango, yogurt, honey, and freshly ground cardamom, and it’s the perfect companion for a hot day! The kids absolutely love this drink.",26,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xs00dn/sharing_family_recipes_bhuna_ghost_karahi_daal/

Other than that, if you're looking to up specific macros, Indian food lends itself pretty well to any diet, whether vegetarian, vegan, low fat, etc. The one that seems a bit challenging to a typical Indian is low carb/keto ... not impossible, but Indian food does place the rice or roti or dosa (or equivalent) at the centre of the meal, so it's difficult to wrap one's head around leaving out that main component or relegating it to a secondary role. Diabetics deal with this, though, so it's not impossible, just needs practice.

For me, it's about staying mostly vegetarian, making sure that even when I do make a meat-based dish, the meal is rounded out with plenty of veg. I try to not overdo the rice/roti, but that's not always a success, so then I just go lift weights. It all works out as long as I just stay aware of how much I'm eating, not just at any one meal, but over the day(s).",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x5t3pu/work_out_meals_diets/

2022-08-29 14:25:41,submission,IndianFood,Has anybody ever combined namkeen with ice cream? Because it's delicious.,"This isn't a recipe so much as a question about namkeen and things you can do with it...

So, my girlfriend is English, although her ethnicity is ""Cape Coloured"" through her mom who is from South Africa. I suppose through this connection she grew up on and now turned me onto ""Bombay Mix"" which we know is really just a placeholder name for a million different salty snacks. And as an anglo I am totally aware of how little I'm aware of all of them. However...

About a year ago, I was running out of one of my favorites made by Bombay Kitchen called ""Tastee Mix"". I had been mixing it with yogurt and even would eat it like a cereal with milk at times. That's when a lightbulb went off. What would this taste like with ice cream? So I put the last of the Tastee Mix with some vanilla ice cream.

Wow.

What a flavor combo.

Now, I'm not stupid enough to think I just invented something delicious. So I jumped online and started searching. I tried to find various words associated with mixes made by Bombay Kitchen, Deep, Haldiram's, Kirch, etc.  What I mean is, I would look at the ingredients and try and see what these various mixes would be called if they didn't have a product name. That's when I discovered the word ""namkeen"", etc.. Anyway, started searching more. I found very fancy desserts that included nuts and raisins with ice cream, but not what I was looking for. So then I started asking proprietors and workers at the markets where I buy mixes and they looked at me funny and would say ""no I just add it to a fry or maybe some yogurt"".

I still cannot fathom that I'm the first one to do this. Does anybody else add namkeen to ice cream?

I've found that you need a mix that has a bit more sugar to start with. Something at least 3 or 5g per serving. It can be spicy, spice helps. Less sugar it doesn't create the same effect.

Since Tastee Mix is impossible to find these days, I've been using Masala Magic (another one by Bombay Kitchen) and I actually like it more.

Anyway, I would really like to know that I'm not the only one doing this. That would be ridiculous because it's a great flavor combination.",2,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x0q3vd/has_anybody_ever_combined_namkeen_with_ice_cream/

It's not my jam, but very experimental ice creams aren't that new in my neck of the woods.  Here's a *really* successful business that thrives on odd combinations:  https://saltandstraw.com/pages/flavors

I think it takes finesse to make these things work, but I don't see why they shouldn't.

Moreover, there's some precedent in Indian cookery to combine sweet and salty, the best example I can think of being fruit chaat.  Mango sorbet with chaat masala is only a few evolutionary steps away from namkeens and ice cream...I would just want the latter to be crafted with great care.

Can anyone recommend a healthier oil alternative that wouldn't derail the authentic Korma flavor? Avocado oil, for instance?

*Also, the Korma I've tasted in the states is always creamy, however, I'm dairy free so no cow's milk yogurt for me. From past and pain-staking research, I found that a brand of coconut milk called Chao Koh's is pretty creamy... Would that work? Any other brand suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!*

*UPDATE:*
Wow. Indian food is difficult to make. Lots of components to make a very specific flavor. What a learning process…

Thanks, everyone, for explaining how to create a “dairy-free” creamy flavor with a combination of cashews and coconut milk. I actually originally needed a healthy oil alternative and ended up addressing something a lot more important in this recipe.

I used 1 can of coconut milk by a brand called Native Forest (I think I actually found out about the brand on this very Reddit when looking for a dairy-free yogurt alternative). It’s a great brand because they make a preservative-free version of coconut milk.

My cream blend included 40 cashews… I need to dial back on the cashews, though, because they have quite a bit of sugar, another think I don’t handle well.

The next thing to tackle with this recipe I found on YouTube are the spices… Not sure if they’re quite right. I think I may want more heat… And maybe cumin??",27,80.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/vnsik0/korma_recipe_calls_for_canola_oil_what_would_be_a/

Stir it at the end or near the end of cooking. To make sure theres enough liquid and not that its all given at the end ill put the coconut milk or cream in the fridge which separates the water out. I add that as that can boil then add the rest. If you just want intense creaminess add the solidified coconut cream/fat feom the can,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/vnsik0/korma_recipe_calls_for_canola_oil_what_would_be_a/

2022-06-30 09:52:19,comment,IndianFood,,"A lot of good answers here.  So I'll give you a cautionary non-answer.  Look up what goes into Thai curry, and unless that's what you're trying to make, which you're not in this case, avoid the majority of what they use.  The flavour profile and consistency and whatnot is drastically different, and a lot of that stems from the ingredients.  You'll notice a lot of things that seem similar or like what you might think to sub, but that's the point: recognise those and pick something else.   No hate toward Thai food, but just a word of caution.  Almond puree, ghee, vegan yoghurt, sunflower oil, all those recommendations are going to be way better.  Also, in your comments I noticed specifically the dairy thing.  In addition to what's been said, there are no- and low-lactose products that aren't bad.  You may have a lactose intolerance, and simply removing that from the equation could open a few doors for you.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/vnsik0/korma_recipe_calls_for_canola_oil_what_would_be_a/

2022-06-25 04:46:10,submission,IndianFood,My favorite Mango Lassi,"I'm a fiend for mango lassi, and this is the recipe I've synthesized and make every time I eat Indian food. Let me know what you do differently, I'm always trying to improve!

**Ingredients:**

\- 2 cups curd or plain yogurt (480-500g)

\- 2 mangos, chopped (or 2 cups/1lb of frozen diced mango)

\- 4-6 tbsp sugar, depending on the ripeness of your mangoes (white or brown)

\- ¾ cup milk (180g)

\- ¾ cup water (180g)

\- ½ tsp ground cardamom (green or white)

\- ½ tsp ground cinnamon

\- Small pinch of salt, to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Core and dice the mangos (if using fresh)
2. Add the ingredients to a blender or spouted bowl/jar
3. Blend in the blender, or with an immersion blender, until the lassi is smooth and pourable
4. Serve in chilled glasses

Or, here's an alternative recipe I made w/ a can of mango pulp I bought recently (honestly just winged this, but it worked like a charm)

**Ingredients:**

\- 1-30oz can sweetened kesar mango pulp (about 3 cups)

\- 3 cups curd or plain yogurt

\- 2 tbsp sugar (white or brown)

\- 1 cup milk (240g)

\- ¾ cup water (180g)

\- ¾ tsp ground cardamom (green or white)

\- ¾ tsp ground cinnamon

\- Small pinch of salt, to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Add the ingredients to a blender or spouted bowl/jar
2. Blend in the blender, or with an immersion blender, until the lassi is smooth and pourable
3. Add up to another ¼ cup of water if it’s too thick
4. Serve in chilled glasses

On the subject of lassi, I've seen people here talk about adding saffron for color, and lime for flavor, to lassi made with fresh mango (I also considered adding citrus because mango pulp has added citric acid). How much would you all suggest I add? And, for the saffron, how do you add that to the lassi? I guess you could just blend it in but I always thought you had to extract the color somehow. Just hoping to make the fresh mango lassi taste as close to the ""restaurant version"" using mango pulp, since it's harder to find.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions, and enjoy!",20,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/vk74hs/my_favorite_mango_lassi/

Coming to Europe, it was a shock to me to see European Indian restaurants selling this as some sort of authentic Indian drink.

It's NOT. And it's not even Mangos. It's cheap Mango syrup stored in cans with tons of sugar mixed with Joghurt. You could do maybe like 10 liters for 4 Euros by buying the syrup at your Indian grocery store.

2022-06-25 22:12:30,comment,IndianFood,,"I’m not Indian, i really have no authority on the matter. But to me, mango lassi was always just apart of the experience when eating Indian food in America. First time I had it, and what i try to replicate when i make mango lassi, was in an Indian-American restaurant owned by a North Indian family I know. Mango lassi is something I’ve associated with that positive experience, whether or not its accurate to the culture.

The mango pulp I’ve bought is just blended mango flesh stored with sugar and citric acid, and some of it is unsweetened but i’ve had trouble finding that kind. To my knowledge I’ve never had a mango lassi made with mango syrup, but I can imagine it isn’t very good, and the way you describe your experience, i probably wouldn’t enjoy it either.

I guess if your complaint is price, the mango lassi I’ve ordered isn’t usually expensive, and making it myself with good mangoes is definitely better in flavor and worth it imo. And honestly, I don’t necessarily see a problem with being able to make a bunch of something for dirt cheap if you enjoy it. To some people that’s a plus, and lassi is just something I enjoy. I don’t necessarily fuss over the value.

I’ve been lucky enough to have had a really good experience with mango lassi, traditional or not. It was never too sweet, and the actual flavor of the curd/yogurt stands out to me, which I enjoy. I’m sure plain lassi, salt lassi, or any other traditional variation will be just as good, but I’ve yet to have the pleasure of trying them, so I’ve just stuck with mango lassi. If you haven’t already, you should try making a mango lassi sometime, ideally with fresh mangoes. That way you can control the sweetness, and use authentic ingredients. You might actually end up liking it",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/vk74hs/my_favorite_mango_lassi/

2022-06-25 06:41:10,comment,IndianFood,,"there’s this very particular sweetness and tartness that you get from mango pulp, and i’m becoming more and more certain it’s from the added citric acid. However, kesar mango pulp is also made with kesar mangoes which definitely contributes to the strong flavor. I just think mango pulp is the better option. I always have to add more sugar when i use fresh mango, and i recommend you try adding lemon or lime juice too. 

Do make sure your mangoes are as ripe as possible. Really the softer the better, at least before they become mushy. i’m undecided on whether to use yellow or green/red mangoes, but kesar mangoes are green if that helps.

I think each is for different tastes, depending on the occasion i prefer the milder version with fresh mango. Both are great, though, and I would probably have to try them side by side to tell you whether one is objectively better.

Generally there is a North/South difference due to the staple grown ie wheat or rice.  More wheat is grown in the North so bread was more common and  Rice in the South but in some places the staple is millet or even sorghum.    Food from the North is somewhat heavier/richer because of climate especially winter style dishes and the use of a lot of dairy in the Punjab and Kashmir (ghee, cream, milk etc)  the South is more vegetarian and tended to be spicier and they used coconut milk and oil.

It comes down to what is locally farmed, gathered or caught as to what the people eat.

2022-04-07 19:44:33,submission,IndianFood,American Indian Restaurant 'Chicken Curry' (Dhaba? Madras? Something Else?),"I've been cooking Indian food on and off for maybe 15 years, more casually than seriously. I do love to get Indian food in Cali from some great places in the Tenderloin in SF, and at Vik's in Berkeley, and closer to home when needing a quick fix.

One of our favorites from all of these places is the 'Chicken Curry', or some other meat with the same sauce. Simple, basic, and seems to be a nearly identical recipe at every restaurant in the US. It's almost always is dairy-free, although I think sometimes a limited amount of yogurt is involved (in the marinating of the meat likely). Obviously some versions are way better than others, but they all have the same flavor profile of onion, ginger, chili, tomato, cumin, coriander, black pepper, tumeric,  cardamom (prob both green and black) and garam masala.

So, my real question is - what is the base recipe/source for this curry? Why have most restaurants in the US adopted this curry as the 'standard'? Most Indian Cookbooks have a basic curry recipe which sometimes gets close to the flavor, but not usually as deep as my favorite restaurants. They are usually included as an intro and meant to be simple. Then regional recipes appear.

The closest I've gotten is a 'Dhaba Chicken' recipe, using mustard oil, and a mix of black and green cardamom. Blending the spices with the onions and using really good tomatoes. I am very close now!! But I figured I would ask to the group, why did this curry become so popular and which part of India did it come from? Or was it from the UK for all I know lol? (Please note, none of the prime examples I love use cream! You may be tempted to go there, but I promise that is not the difference. Restaurant levels of salt and ghee for sure, but not cream).

Thank you for any help you might provide. Really appreciate it.

**Edit:** For the record, some info gleaned from all the suggestions and some additional info. The curry is likely sourcing from at one point and actual Indian dish, likely from Northern India. According to my local who makes the best rendition of this:  '*It is not specifically Punjabi/Dhaba, it is a 'Northern Indian Curry' that is common in the area I am from. It is very similar to Dhaba, but the spices are a little different.*' Another poster pointed out that Punjabi dishes use more coriander and I can confirm the dish I am referencing is more strongly flavored with cumin. As others have pointed out, the dish may be based on a more standard gravy, like the UK curry houses use. While it's possible, the versions I am most familiar with do not have that intense creamy-ness from pureed veggies, they resemble a rough blend with onions and tomato, similar to home cooking. I'll be trying a few tweaks in the next weeks at home, and if I finally nail it, I'll post the recipe in the sub as a thank you for all the super interesting information people have shared.

2022-04-07 20:18:52,comment,IndianFood,,"The typical chicken curry in most US restaurants is an offshoot of the classic British takeout Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Madras.

The base varies from restaurant to restaurant, but the main components are like you mentioned. Note that it's pretty much the same base that's used across most dishes (onion, tomato, whole garam masala, cashews and/or cream, coriander, cumin, turmeric and chilli powders), but they get used slightly differently and the finishing spices are entirely different.

The reason restaurant version tastes better than your home attempts and has much much deeper flavor is because -

1. Butter


2. High quality stock replaces water in almost all cook-downs (when you cook down onion, spices and ginger-garlic and add tomatoes, most restaurants would also add a good deal of stock to help it cook for long durations without burning; the stock of course adds tons of flavour)


3. Degree of cook downs - while most restaurants won't use truly caramelized onions (i.e. french onion level), they will still let their onions brown deep and get nutty


4. Finishing techniques - almost all individual components are reinforced in the final finish - a fresh hit of garam masala, butter, kasuri methi etc. are added as the cook prepares an individual portion


5. Just better cooking - restaurants are pretty obsessive over the ratio of their garam masala or coriander/cumin powders etc. So they can make fairly tasty food consistently


6. Butter",18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/tyl27j/american_indian_restaurant_chicken_curry_dhaba/

North Indian curries are heavily inspired by Mughlai Cuisine so they have lots of onions, kasuri Methi, cream, nuts, rose water etc. 
South Indian curries have lots of coconuts and curry leaves. 
West Indian curries have mustard and nuts. 
East Indian are generally sweeter and more creamy. 

Indians don't use oils other than mustard for their proteins, it tastes better. We caramelize onion so much that it turns brown and dark. We use tomato but not to the extend that the world uses in curries. We use lots of other spices too rather than cumin. We use whole garam masala and not just curry powder. 
In fact we don't know what curry powder means! It doesn't exist in my country.

2022-04-08 02:22:58,comment,IndianFood,,"I don't know any cookbooks exist for the style of restaurant food that has developed in the US, UK Australia etc.

The majority of these dishes have come from Northern styles of cooking mostly Punjabi but also Kashmiri styles  where slow cooking methods have been used for millenia. Then filtered through the world as acceptable for foreigners to eat.  In itself it is almost a distinct style within Indian food as any of the regional styles

I worked as a student in Indian restaurants and the chef would do a gravy cook most days.  Copious use of onions, ginger, garlic would be cooked down in the kitchen and spices added according to the flavour profile.

Then to prepare the dish on order the chef might saute some onion especially in a do pyaz dish (onions two ways) and any veg being used with the protein - peas, potato, bell pepper etc with pieces of whatever protein (some of which might be par cooked in the tandoor) adding ghee and some more spices to the 'gravy' for 'freshness'  Unless you have hours and hours you wont replicate this at home - although I have seen a butter chicken recipe that a friend made that was pretty close.

Frankly you need to make some Indian friends who cook- you'll never look at the restaurant style again as being the best LOL

But for home cooking if you want a gravy style check out Malaysian Indian food.  They make a lot of pastes (rempah) that they will fry in oil which produces a similar result.   A lot of Kashmiri dishes have ground nuts in the sauces etc and so do Malaysian styles",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/tyl27j/american_indian_restaurant_chicken_curry_dhaba/

The basic chicken curry recipe varies wildly across the various regions of India. And i mean wildly!

You have tons of answers already, but i think what you should be asking is the various kinds of chicken curry that various parts of India and Pakistan and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka tends to cook.

As a short sampler, you can look at Goalondo chicken curry which is probably the simplest and yet tastiest chicken curry you can eat. And you can also look at the Punjabi chicken curry which is what restaurants tend to serve, with many modifications to amp up the fat level. You can also look at the drastically different Maharashtrian chicken curry which has multiple variants from the chicken curry cooked with goda masala to the Sahuji or Saoji style, to the Kolhapuri chicken curry which is completely different from what restaurants serve as ""Kolhapuri chicken"" which is just a buzzword for amping up the heat level. Real kolhapuri meat cooking is fairly mild and very nuanced and flavorful in comparison.

I'm a chicken curry enthusiast and will try the ""curry chicken"" even at Chinese/Japanese restaurants. And I *really* miss the chicken curry my Punjabi friends' mums used to make when I was little, growing up in India. I now eat my way across North America.

But in general, the bog-standard ""chicken curry"" you find in restaurants outside India (despite their adaptations for local tastebuds) tends to be based on what's called ""kadhai chicken"" or ""chicken kadhai"" (kadhai is alternatively spelled karahi) in North India and Pakistan. It's your typical onion/ginger/garlic/tomato base, plus a load of delicious spices. Sometimes they'll throw in some slices of bell pepper.

As for being related to Tikka Masala, not close at all for me. Different flavor profiles. Very very close to Punjabi Dhaba chicken tho. Madras in the ballpark, but different again as well.

2022-04-07 22:20:46,comment,IndianFood,,"Great answer. This is pretty much it tbh. 
OP's description of the components + mustard oil + dhaba screams out Punjab to me :) Though it is just as likely to be Punjab via Bengal/Bangladesh. 

As to why a lot of restaurants in the US have accepted this as standard - my theory (based on my limited knowledge) is that by the time there was a sizeable Indian diaspora in the States, Americans had had some taste of Indian food in the UK. This image of what Indian food looked and tasted like was already present in the collective consciousness. So when folks tried opening Indian restaurants they must have adapted their recipes to match what their customers had in mind. A simple matter of supplying what was in demand. 

The other simpler explanation is this version is standard because even in Indian restaurants this gravy is pretty much the standard. It is used for a wide variety of dishes, hits all of the salt-fat-acid-heat-umami notes, and is versatile enough to taste very different based on how it is flavoured and finished. It is also relatively easy to prepare compared to the other types of gravies from say Mughlai cooking - a style of cooking again from north India, but from the regions around Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, etc. 

Whether any of these are ""the"" reason is beyond my knowledge of the evolution of Indian food. I'd be interested in hearing any ideas you folks have :)",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/tyl27j/american_indian_restaurant_chicken_curry_dhaba/
2022-04-08 14:30:36,comment,IndianFood,,"Wanted to add a few things to your response, all your points are spot on.  


>a fresh hit of garam masala, butter, kasuri methi etc

Kasuri methi goes a long way in helping bridge the gap at home! Also, butter to finish is almost as important using a combo of butter & oil to start the recipe. The Fresh hit of butter adds a different flavor than the cooked butter you started with.  


>High quality stock replaces water in almost all cook-downs

A lot of restaurants make whats known as a BIR style which often starts with preparing a ""base gravy"". The base gravy can be prepared in large batches and frozen to use over a few months for most home cooks. Most of the curry dishes start with the base gravy and layer in spices and meats.

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7CZDpOLnQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7CZDpOLnQk) 

Lastly, a lot of home cooks when they first start try to go with bone less chicken breast. Bone in meat is the way to go!!! It adds a lot of flavor and a richer texture to your final result of the dish. The low and slow method is absolutely key here once you get the onions browned.

'No it is not specifically Dhaba, it is a 'Northern Indian Curry' that is common in the area I am from. It is very similar to Dhaba, but the spices are a little different.'

Based on a bunch of the responses, I think the general common root is 'Northern Indian Curry' which is obviously again super generic, but searching for this online does yield very similar flavor profiles.

I cover the sambhar in the fridge and take out as much as I need each day and it lasts really well.  SO I cook about a total of 3 1/2 hours over a week

Biryani is so different depending on where you go for instance. Vik's Chaat in Berkeley is my reference for Lamb Biryani, holy shit levels of good. Shalimar too although it's been years since I've had theirs. Korma is another one that is very different depending on where you go. Perhaps b/c it's cheaper, but most places use cream instead of cashews as the base and the dish suffers greatly. Flavor is all over the place too. I love making Korma at home.

> My Punjabi friend keyed my in to the concept of Dhaba stalls and told me she thinks that style is so common around India it might be why that flavor dominates here. 

Yeah, so I have never been to an actual Dhaba in Punjab but I have had a Punjabi friend describe Dhaba style cuisine as very minimalistic while attempting to be high in calories/protein. So it is entirely possible that there is some minimum subset of ingredients that they are using as a core base which is then tempered one way to generate this curry, while mixed with a creamier base to generate Korma/Tikka Masala.

edit: Minor note, but I'd be very doubtful if they are actually using Mustard oil to generate this. Reason being that most mustard oil (except for Yandilla which is fairly expensive) in the US is not food grade and I imagine that they'd run into health inspector type issues if they served non food grade oil in a commercial kitchen.",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/tyl27j/american_indian_restaurant_chicken_curry_dhaba/

Korma using blended cashews and/or cream, diluting the power of the gravy. Shame so many Indian places in the US rely on cream tho.

When I added my chicken to my tomato, cream pan the yogurt that was on the chicken curdled.

Years ago, I knew a woman from Mumbai who made the most amazing chicken curry. She wouldn't give anyone her recipe, but said the chicken was marinated overnight in yogurt and curry spices.

I've found a marinade recipe I'm trying right now- got my chicken sitting in yogurt, curry powder, garam masala, ground cardamom, lime, salt, and sugar. Really excited to see how it comes out.

But, the curry was so different from what I've found in   restaurants- the broth was brown and thin, like chicken soup, but darker with richer flavor. It wasn't thick or creamy. It's one of the best things I've ever eaten. 

My question is, does anyone know how to finish this recipe? I know to boil the chicken and add ""spices"", but I don't know which ones or how much. I know she threw in a handful of cardamom pods, but that's it.

For 250g curry-cut bone in chicken,

Roast a whole medium size onion and a little bit of dry coconut on open flame. Make it good and charred. Remove excess burnt onion skin, (just washing it under tap works)

Chop roughly, add 3-4 cloves of garlic and about an inch of ginger. Blend everything. Keep aside.

Finely chop a small onion. 

I use a small pressure cooker, in which add 1  tablesp oil, add a little cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let it sputter. Add the small onion, saute. Add little tumeric, salt. Let the onions turn golden brown. Add chicken pieces. Saute till tey change color to white. Add about a cup - 300 ml water. Pressure cook the chicken.

Another pan. 1 tablespoon Oil, mustard seeds, sputter, add the first blended paste, cook/saute till raw smell is gone. Add garam masala, red chilli powder, (or just the kolhapuri masala) depending on how hot you like it, about a bit less than half tsp should be good enough. tumeric, saute. Also salt to taste. Remember the pressure cooked chicken has salt too.

This is curry base. Make two parts of this mixture. To one part add the already cooked chicken from the pressure cooker and saute. This gives dry chicken. 

To the soup from pressure cooker add the rest of curry base and boil it, qdd water to the consistency you desire, and you have that lovely brown red curry.

Restaurants use corn starch or some other thickening agent for curries, they even use food colors. Some store bought masala blends may also contain thickening agents. If you want a thin yet colorful and flavorful curry then whole spices is the best way.

Some thoughts and pointers:

Don't cook garam masala for a long time, its already toasted(garam=heated/roasted), cooking it too much makes it lose the aroma and taste. Add it before the last 5-10 mins of cooking. Overcooked garam masala tastes like wood.
Don't be discouraged if you fail the first time, Indian food seems tricky because sometimes there are no rigid rules or recipes with weight measures or even time required for a step. Its about the color, sound, aroma of things while they cook. Just follow your heart and your senses, you'll be cooking great curries in no time.

Ingredients
(marinade)

•2 lbs chicken breast

1 - 1 ½ cup Greek yogurt

•2 tsp garlic powder

•1 tsp kosher salt

•1 tsp garam masala

•1 tsp cumin

•1 tsp curry powder

•1 tbsp lemon juice


(sauce)
•1 tbsp olive oil

•4 tbsp unsalted butter

•1 medium yellow onion

•15 oz tomato sauce

•2 tsp garlic powder

•2 tsp garam masala

•1 tsp cumin

•1 tsp ground ginger

•1 tsp chili powder

•2 tsp curry powder

•1 cup heavy whipping cream

•2 tsp monkfruit sweetener sugar substitute

•1 tsp kosher salt 

•2 tsp chopped cilantro to garnish


Directions
To marinade the chicken chop up the chicken breast into 1 in pieces, add to a bowl. Add in Greek yogurt, garlic powder, kosher salt, garam masala, cumin, curry powder and lemon juice. Combine well to coat all pieces of chicken. Place in the refrigerator for at least an hour up to overnight is fine.

To cook the chicken over medium high heat add olive oil and 3 tbsp of unsalted butter. Add all chicken in to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes until the chicken is 70% cooked. Stirring constantly so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan and browns up too much. Remove the chicken and liquid from the pan, add the remaining butter as well as the chopped onion and cook for 2-3 minutes. Once onions are soft, lower the heat to low and add the seasonings. Garlic powder, garam masala, cumin, ground ginger, chili powder, and curry powder. Mix the seasonings well with the onions scrapping all bits of flavor from the bottom of the pan. Once well combined turn the heat back up to medium and cook for 45 seconds to a minute make sure it doesn't burn. Next add tomato sauce, heavy whipping cream, monkfruit sweetener and salt to taste. Add chicken back to the sauce and cook on low for 15 minutes to continue cooking the chicken all the way through",2,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/q6qor7/butter_chicken/

2021-07-08 18:16:35,submission,IndianFood,Instant Pot Yogurt," Instant pot Yogurt

Making yogurt in instant pot is extremely cost effective and easy to make. You can make plain yogurt or Greek yogurt. It is healthy, fresh, tasty and creamy and you can make so many dishes from breakfast to dinner.

Ingredients:

8 Cups Milk

¼ Cup Yogurt

Equipment:

Instant Pot

Instructions:

Sterilize the inner pot of instant pot with boiling water and vinegar.

Dry and put it back in the instant pot.

Add 8 cups of milk.

Turn on the instant pot.

Press yogurt button

Select boil

Let yogurt come to almost 180F

General rule of thumb is it happens right after first boil.

Then let it cool down to 110-115F

Add yogurt 

Mix well

Remove the Seal band from your instant pot lid

Close the lid

Keep it on vent

Press yogurt button again

This time when the option “low” blinks select that

Then select either 18 or 24 hours

The longer it incubates the better.

Or you can custom select your temperature and incubate it for 9 hours.

After 18-24 hours yogurt looks perfectly thick no need to strain excess water.

But after 9 hours my yogurt looks runny so I take a bowl put a sieve on top pour all the yogurt in it close it with lid and let it sit in refrigerator for couple of hours and it thickens.

That’s how you make Greek yogurt.

When the yogurt reaches its perfect consistency first thing I do is to freeze ½ a cup as a starter for next time.

Then we make breakfast bowls, smoothie bowls, flavored yogurt, kadhi pakora, Gyro Sauce, karahi, chicken tikka masala, biryani and what not.",7,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ogd0r1/instant_pot_yogurt/

2021-05-05 23:14:25,submission,IndianFood,"Soaking, sprouting, dry-cooking, lentils and split chickpeas--plz help me understand","I have starting caring for an Indian grandmother about 4 weeks ago. She is absolutely amazing to me.  We spend a lot of time cooking and cleaning. I love to cook and had cooked with turmeric, coriander, cloves, sumac, curry, and asofetida etc before.  I'm learning and appreciating buttermilk and yogurt.  I follow her around sniffing and tasting--""Is that--semolina? yes?!"" Her food is almost never in the original container so it's always extra guessing, lol.  She was born in South India but spent much of her time in the North. 
oh, i'm sorry. 
She soaks lentils/split chickpeas in water then spreads them on a cloth for maybe a day and a half, then dry-cooks them in a skillet with whole dried or fresh serrano chilies (I think). Then she stores them and uses them kind of as a condiment or strongly flavored ingredient--maybe uses 1/4 to 1/3 cup of them in her dishes. The legumes are darker when she is done with them. Can anyone help me with the times that they are soaked and dried?  Am I missing a step? I'm not with her all the times, so I don't see the process from beginning to end. I love how completely different the beans are from how they are cooked in the West. I think she does the same process to lentils and split chick peas. One time I saw the chickpeas in a small pressure cooker she uses, so maybe she cooks the chickpeas and not the lentils after soaking and drying them?   Thanks so much! And is there a name for this?

2021-03-23 19:43:04,submission,IndianFood,Wondering if I should make any modifications to my existing Chicken Tikka Masala recipe,"Currently, I very much like how this dish turns out, it's very tasty. It doesn't taste QUITE how it does in restaurants, but pretty close. I'm just looking for feedback to see if there are any flavor profiles or techniques I may be missing out on to give it more restaurant style taste. 

[Here is the google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T5XvARh99Mx56DuEu5tDojmrD0S0X0L00CQ4zp2JAXw/edit?usp=sharing) I made for my own version of this recipe, which is mostly just Kenji's recipe with a few small changes.

If you can't access that, here it is

Ingredients

* 3-5 pounds chicken breasts or thighs
* 2 cups plain yogurt
* 5 tablespoons Ginger-Garlic Paste
* 3/4 cup lemon juice
* ¼ cup kosher salt
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons toasted ground cumin
* 3 tablespoons toasted paprika
* 2 tablespoon toasted ground coriander seed
* 2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 tablespoon kashmiri chili powder
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 2 large onion, thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, roughly mashed
* 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2-3 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves

Instructions

Slice the chicken into bite sized chunks. Place in a large bowl.

Combine cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside 3 tablespoons of spice mixture. 

Combine remaining 6 tablespoons spice mixture, 3 tablespoons ginger garlic paste, yogurt, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and 1/4 cup salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Pour marinade all over chicken pieces, using hands to coat every surface. Cover loosely and refrigerate. Allow to marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 8.

TO COOK UNDER THE BROILER: Line a broiler pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and preheat the broiler to high with the rack set 6 inches below broiler element. Place raised cooling rack. Broil until charred and blackened on surface, about 8 minutes (chicken will not be completely cooked through—this is ok).

Heat ghee in a large Dutch Oven. Add onions, and caramelize on low heat for 30-40 minutes.

Add remaining 6 tablespoons ginger garlic paste, cook until fragrant, and then add tomato paste. Cook mixture, stirring frequently, until dark and beginning to char in spots, about 10 minutes. 

Add reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and half of cilantro, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan with a spoon. Simmer for 15 minutes, then puree using a hand blender or by transferring to a tabletop blender in batches.

Stir in cream, remaining quarter cup lemon juice, honey, and fenugreek leaves. Season to taste with salt, then set aside until chicken is cooked.

Transfer chicken chunks to pot of sauce. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.",50,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/mbmz4n/wondering_if_i_should_make_any_modifications_to/

2021-03-23 21:02:54,comment,IndianFood,,"My guy/gal, I’m in exactly the same boat. I’m in the UK so there’s a six week window of decent tomatoes and I refuse to pay like £5 for a punnet of tasty posh ones if I’m going to be cooking them. Cherry tomatoes tend to be more flavourful than big ones but the skins are much tougher so cooking them in a sauce isn’t ideal. I don’t have a lot of money so for cooking I just buy the string bag of “family tomatoes” from Lidl but I’ll leave them on the windowsill in the sun until they’re much, much softer than they’d be when you buy them. Obviously not rotten or mouldy or off, but they give when you squeeze them. I think that helps a bit but honestly, the crap ones we get supplemented with tomato paste (possibly a bit more sugar too) gives a really different result than using tinned tomatoes. Thinking about it, it could be that using a whole tin of tomatoes just makes it too tomatoey but I don’t know. If you’re not convinced by my fresh tomato thing, maybe just fish out a whole tomato from the tin and use that, then keep the rest of the tin (and juice) for something else. 

As for the sugar, try it in half teaspoon increments and just keep tasting. Do the same with salt - you’d be surprised at how much restaurants use. Be sparing with both as you’re adding them though, you obviously can’t remove either of those things after you’ve added them. Err on the side of caution and give it a good two or three tastes between adding more.

2. Base spices - turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, cayenne or paprika. Maybe fennel as well.

I recognize Karachi is in Pakistan, however the Pakistani food subreddit seems a little quiet.

I went searching for videos like these after years of disappointing Chicken Tikka (and masala) attempts. I was inspired though by the deeply impactful and delicious flavors on offer at my local Pakistani joint, which is no doubt somewhere in between a ""truly authentic"" rendition (they do cook it using a wood-burning tandoor), and a westernized rendition in which the sauce is included. It's this 'in-between' type of result I'm seeking.

So far this video is the only resource I've found that's left me thinking, ""OK, now if I do something like this, maybe I could actually achieve a similar level of deliciousness"", although the instructions in the description seem completely detatched from what's happening in the video.

Clearly all my previous ratios of spices/herbs to broth/liquid was far too weak. I'm liking this video as a jumping off point for the Chicken Tikka component. For those familiar with Indian/Pakistani cuisine, how would you go about creating the masala sauce?

Would you use the exact same ratios as the yogurt marinade, or something different? If I care this much, should I go through the trouble of frying whole spices and grinding it up in a mortar and pestle?  Any input, chicken tikka success stories, or resources welcome :).

Also sorry to inquire about literally the most popular dish. At this particular Pakistani restaurant their Chicken Tikka Masala just blows everything else they make out of the water, even in comparison to other Indian and Pakistani restaurants. Kormas, Vindaloos, Makanwhalas, Jalfrezis... Nothing compares to the flavor impact. Once I make culinary progress I will be looking to broaden my horizons.

Restaurant-Style Butter Chicken: No blender, grill, oven, or overnight marination required!

TL;DR: Chicken thighs don’t need to be marinated for more than a few minutes, stir fry your chicken on high heat in a wok in small batches, dice your onions very fine and cook them to hell, use tomato paste instead of fresh tomatoes, and of course, abundant spices, salt, sugar, butter, and cream.

This is a recipe born out of laziness, out of wanting to make as few dirty dishes as possible for me to clean up afterwards, while simultaneously trying to replicate restaurant style cooking as much as possible. Throughout it, I also detail quite a few techniques that generally should be used for all North Indian restaurant style gravy curry dishes. Yes, some of this is not necessarily authentic, but what’s important to me is that the end result tastes good. Many of the choices I make in this recipe are from countless hours of watching various videos on the same dish, hundreds of recipe blogs claiming that their version is the most authentic and tasty, and the consultation of one of my Indian friends who was taught by his aunt, a professional chef in India. Many of the ingredients are also optional and can be skipped if you do not have access to an Indian/Asian grocery store.

Before I list the ingredients, I do want to make a note of two essential cooking tools that are needed for this specific recipe. One, a large wok. And two, a gas burner stove. The reason? In lieu of having to preheat an oven, turn on the broiler, or fire up the grill for the chicken part of this recipe, I instead stir fry my chicken on high heat in small batches. This fusion of Chinese cooking technique into an Indian dish allows for an approximation of the smoky flavor that is typically desired, with much less time and effort needed to do so. Yes, I know that true butter chicken is made with leftover tandoori chicken, but I hate waiting for my oven to preheat and god knows when I’ll ever fire up the grill for anything other than bbq.

Ingredients:

Chicken Marinade:

•	Boneless, skinless, chicken thighs – about 8 or so. You can also use breast meat, but I would advise marinating overnight if you do so. Thighs can be pretty much cooked immediately after mixing with the rest of these ingredients.

•	Kashmiri red chili powder – 2 tablespoons-ish

•	Turmeric powder – 1 tablespoon-ish

•	Coriander powder – 1 tablespoons-ish

•	Garlic and ginger paste – 2 tablespoons-ish. I actually forgot these once, for both the marinade and the gravy, and it still tasted wonderful. So, I guess they’re optional?

•	Juice from one lemon

•	Whole fat yogurt – or curd if you have access to it. About 4 tablespoons

•	Salt – to taste. I eyeball this the same way I eyeball the spices.

•	Ground black pepper – 1 tablespoon-ish. I’d advise buying a large container of whole peppercorns and grinding it with a mortar and pestle or spice/coffee grinder since it would take forever to grind out a tablespoon of pepper by hand.

•	Oil that can handle high temperatures – both for the marinade and for stir frying. About a tablespoon for the marinade and a tablespoon for each batch of chicken that you stir fry.

•	Kasuri methi – large handful

Noticeably absent from this list is cumin powder. Some recipes have it, some don’t, and I’ve tried both. It just tastes off with cumin for some reason. Yes the MDH spice mix has cumin in it, but not to the concentration that I would normally use in a recipe like this. Also absent from the gravy ingredients below is cumin seeds for the same reason.

Gravy:

•	2 or more large red onions – It’s pretty much impossible to have too much onion in a recipe since you can always cook it down until it basically disappears. I’ve made this with 4 onions before and it tasted great.

•	1 stick of unsalted butter – and don’t you dare use any less. In fact, use more if you have money to burn. My friend told me that when he makes dal mahkani (butter lentils) he uses even more butter than he does for murgh mahkani (butter chicken). And his dal mahkani was the best I’ve ever had in my life. You really can’t have too much.

•	Oil to supplement in case the curry gets dry while cooking.

•	Small can of tomato paste – along with the onions, this is the most important component of the gravy. You’ll supplement with water to actually turn it into a gravy.

•	Chili, turmeric, and coriander powders – same as for the chicken. You need some to marinade and some to be bloomed in hot oil for true depth of flavor. Although I no longer bloom my spices directly in oil since they burn so easily. I instead mix them with the onions after they’ve separated from the oil.

•	Garlic and ginger paste – see above.

•	Thai bird’s eye chilis – completely optional, but you can add some at the beginning for some heat.

•	Garam masala powder – about a tablespoon. In many of the Indian recipes I’ve read, not just for butter chicken, they all advise to bloom cumin, chili, turmeric, and coriander in the hot oil near the beginning of the recipe, except for garam masala, which was almost always advocated to be mixed in near the end when the gravy has already formed. I looked around on some forums and the consensus seems to be that one; since garam masala (in powder form at least) is already toasted and then ground up, it doesn’t need to be sputtered in oil, and two: adding it near the end allows for its warmth to retain prominence in the dish rather than being cooked away.

•	Sugar – 2 tablespoons-ish

•	Half pint of heavy cream

•	Salt – to taste. Oftentimes I don’t even need to add anymore since I add so much to the chicken initially.

•	Kasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) – large handful

•	Fresh bunch of coriander – Not a big deal if you don’t have it, but it adds a nice freshness to the creaminess that can get overwhelming at times.

•	If you want to be more authentic, you can include the stereotypical whole spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, etc. but I’ve personally never really noticed too much difference omitting them. If you do use them, crackle them in the oil before you add your onions and take them out when serving.

If you’re familiar with butter chicken recipes, you might also notice the lack of cashew nuts. Typically they’re added to provide creaminess to the gravy, but there’s already an entire bottle of cream in this thing. I find it kind of pointless. Also using them would require blending the mixture and I try to avoid using my blender as much as possible because I hate cleaning it. If you can somehow source cashew paste, then you could add a few tablespoons when you put in the tomato paste, but it’s really not worth the hassle or money in my opinion.

Steps:

1.	Cut your chicken into bite sized cubes and throw all of the ingredients into a bowl and mix together until evenly coated. Adjust quantities to your liking, just make sure that it has a nice orange-red color and the mixture isn’t too dry (More yogurt, lemon juice, or oil can help).

2.	Heat a few tablespoons of high heat oil (or ghee) in a wok on high heat over the largest gas burner you have. Make sure to turn your range hood on high as well so you don’t smoke up your entire house. (Is it just me, or do Americans hate using their range hoods? Every friend’s house I’ve been to, no one ever uses it when they’re cooking. My mom instilled in me from a very young age to always turn the range hood on high when cooking no matter what. It seems like a cultural difference between Western and Eastern cooks.) Just as the oil begins to smoke, add a small portion of your chicken to the wok so that it just covers the bottom. If you’re using 8 thighs, try to do this in 4 batches. (This technique of small batch wok cooking was taken from J. Kenji Lopez Alt. and Alex French Guy Cooking. If you put in all of the chicken at the same time, you’ll end up boiling it instead of searing and stir frying it which doesn’t result in the same flavor profile. Stir frying is not necessary, as you could just cook everything at once, but it’s the easiest way to approximate the charred smoky flavor of a tandoor/grill. If you don’t have a gas stove but still want that grilled flavor, you’ll have to use your oven. Plenty of recipes on how to do that online.)

3.	Let the chicken sear on a single side for about a minute. If water starts to become visible and the chicken starts to boil instead of stir fry, move the chicken away from the center of the wok to let the water evaporate. Most western gas ranges direct the flames in a circle away from the center of a pan, so the center of the wok won’t actually be the hottest portion for cooking purposes. However, due to the shape of a wok, water will tend to pool in the center. Moving whatever you’re cooking to the outside of the wok will both expose it to higher heat and separate it from the water which will still be touching a part of the wok that is hot enough to boil the water off.

4.	Once you get a nice sear on one side of the chicken pieces, start stir frying by flipping the chicken in the wok with one hand and stirring with the other hand. Hopefully you should see some flames appear as the oil particles catch the direct heat of the burner. This is essential for the nice lightly charred flavor. After a few minutes, transfer the chicken to a bowl, making sure to take the wok off the direct heat so you don’t accidentally burn the leftover oil. Don’t worry about cooking the chicken all the way through at this point, the stir fry sear is just to increase the depth of flavor.

5.	Repeat with the remaining batches of chicken, adding oil as necessary to make sure the chicken doesn’t stick.

6.	Once all of the chicken has been cooked, return the wok to the burner and reduce the heat to medium-high. Add half a stick of butter, let it melt (doesn’t have to be completely) and add your red onions, diced as fine as possible. Remember, we’re not blending this, so the smaller your onion dice, the easier it’ll disappear into the final gravy.

7.	Cook your onions until completely brown and caramelized. This will take a long time, bare minimum of around 30 minutes. Don’t turn the heat up to try and speed up the process, you’ll just burn them instead. This is one of the most important steps for a great tasting gravy. You can also add your garlic and ginger paste at pretty much any point in this process, just try and make sure that they make direct contact with the hot oil rather than being thrown on top of the onions. This principle of making sure every ingredient makes contact with hot oil was taught to me by my friend, who said that the direct contact with hot oil allows for the flavor of the ingredient to permeate throughout the entire dish more strongly. He actually advocated for putting in garlic and ginger paste before the onions (as have numerous online recipes) so that the onions don’t absorb all the oil before the pastes can touch it, but I’ve found that this results in excessive sputtering that makes a giant mess and burns my arms. Instead, I just use enough oil/butter so that the onions can’t absorb all of it. Hence, one stick of butter.

8.	Add the can of tomato paste and mix it into the onions thoroughly for a few minutes. 

9.	Turn the heat down to low and add of all the powdered spices. There’ll be enough residual heat in the pan to nicely toast the spices; leaving it on medium can easily burn them if you’re not careful. At this point, the oil should have somewhat separated from the onions and tomato paste, so you can toss the spices directly on top and mix together. Add oil if the mixture seems too dry. Cook for about a minute, and then begin to add water, a few tablespoons at a time. Adding about a half cup of water will turn the mixture into a very nice and homogenous red curry paste that can be used as a base for other dishes such as palak paneer, chana masala, dal makhani, or restaurant style aloo gobi. However, for this recipe, we’re going to add an additional one and a half cups of water to turn it into a gravy.

10.	As you mix the water in, the mixture will gradually change consistency from a paste to a gravy. Add more water if necessary but be careful not to add too much because you’ll have to boil it off otherwise if the mixture becomes too watery. Add the chicken back into the wok and stir it into the gravy, making sure to include the accumulated juices. Turn the heat back up to medium-high and continue stewing for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

11.	Add another half stick of butter and mix until completely melted.

12.	Add the sugar and garam masala. You can also add some additional Kashmiri chili powder to enhance the color of the dish if you want. Stir until homogenous. Taste the gravy, and add more salt if necessary. I personally like additional sweetness in mine, so I’ll usually add quite a bit more sugar.

13.	Turn the heat off and dump your bottle of cream in. Mix together until the gravy becomes a nice light orange color.

14.	Pour some kasuri methi into your hand and rub your hands together over the gravy, letting it crumble into small pieces. Mix together one more time, and transfer to your serving bowl (or just move the entire wok to the dining table on top of a small cutting board like me because you don’t want to clean another bowl).

15.	Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves and eat with roti, kulcha, or paratha.

A small side note about eating habits that I’ve noticed comparing my Indian and American friends when eating Indian food (and with Indian food Youtubers). Pretty much all of my Indian friends eat their curries with bread that isn’t naan and no rice, and pretty much all of my American friends eat their curries with naan and rice. I’ve adopted my Indian friends’ methods, and it allows me to eat much more curry than with rice. Plus, onion kulcha tastes amazing and I personally much prefer it to naan or rice.",196,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/lwbw94/my_noblender_butter_chicken_recipe_that_ive/

2021-05-17 19:24:10,comment,IndianFood,,"Nice recipe and video - really liked how used the wok - I've always suspected they'd be great for curries. 

I did want to caution you on the authenticity claims regarding flatbread though. It might be tempting to make big conclusions and sweeping generalizations based on what you see your friends or people on YouTube do but keep in mind India is huge place with diverse eating habits.

While I agree it is typical that north Indian curries are served with flatbread - it's not inauthentic for them to be eaten with rice - and many people, myself included like the option of both. I'll usually eat half with paratha and half with rice. And honestly if I had to choose one or the other - I'd choose rice. I will say I do think most of my family members would choose flatbread. 

So just be careful not to conflate ""typical"" with ""authentic"" - Indians are not as gatekeep-y as say the Italians are with what constitutes the proper way to eat something. 

I know you say youre not trying to gatekeep but when you say something is more authentic or that only ""Americans"" ( sidenote some Americans are in fact Indian - it was weird to me that you phrased it as your Indian friends vs American friends as im assuming some are both?) and redditors serve curries with rice and naan - you're not only gatekeeping but you're perpetuating an inaccuracy",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/lwbw94/my_noblender_butter_chicken_recipe_that_ive/

2021-01-31 20:47:07,comment,IndianFood,,"I made some [coriander-mint chutney](https://imgur.com/a/kGKp48R) over the weekend and it came out perfectly. If you're using a Preethi mixer, you're already on the right track. Making chutneys like this one is a little bit of a taste as you go kinda thing. Start with smaller amounts of sugar, salt and lime juice and taste as you go to balance the flavours. Here are the ingredients I used along with approximate proportions (I didn't measure everything by weight this time, unfortunately):

\- coriander: 1 cup or around 50-80g (stems and leaves)

\- mint: 2-3 sprigs (only the leaves)

\- ginger: 25g

\- green chillies: 2-3 (de-seeded)

\- 1/2 tbsp sugar

\- 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)

\- 1/2 lime juiced

\- 1 tbsp greek yoghurt

\- 30ml or so ice water or ice to adjust consistency

First blend together the ginger and chillies, then add the mint and coriander leaves, after a few pulses of the blender, add the other ingredients and blend till smooth. 

Tips:

\- Mint: Only use a small amount of mint leaves, even though many restaurants call it mint chutney, most of the times, it's actually just coriander chutney. Too much mint will make the chutney bitter and unpalatable. 

\- Ice: Instead of using water to help blend the chutney together, I usually use an ice cube instead, this helps the mixture from overheating and cooking while mixing in the blender, and thus helps the chutney retain it's bright green colour.

\- Don't overblend: If you blend everything for too long, the heat of the blender will cook the herbs and the chutney will lose its refreshing taste.

\- Balance sour, sweet and salty: Start small, taste and adjust :)

1/2 batch of mint leaves

However, I'm currently obsessed with this TJ's item. I've made other versions of this and butter chicken before and the process is fairly standard, however, I'm never able to mimic the flavor. The ingredients are pretty simple but the most critical one is just listed as ""spices"" so I'm back at square one.

Does anyone have a solid, copycat recipe that tastes close to the frozen version at TJ's?

In case anyone is interested in taking a stab at it, here are all the ingredients, as listed on the packet:

Most places aren't simmering cinnamon, cardamom, etc. separately, it's too expensive and time consuming.

[3 Minutes Video Recipe](https://youtu.be/a45qxakCMLI)

###**WRITTEN RECIPE**

**Serves : 3 to 4**

###**INGREDIENTS**

* Oil - 1 tbsp

* Green Chillies - 2 (Finely Chopped)

* Tomatoes - 1 cup (Finely Chopped)

* Salt as per taste

Dry spices such as

* Roasted Cumin Powder - 1/2 tbsp 

* Coriander Powder - 1/2 tbsp

* Red Chilli Powder - 1/2 tsp

* Black Pepper Powder - 1/2 tbsp

* Black Salt - 1 tsp

* Chole - 1/2 cup (Optional)

* Boiled Potato - 1 big size (diced)

* Water - 1/2 cup

* Dry mango powder - 1 tbsp 

* Chopped Onions - 1/4th cup (optional)

* Bhujiya Sev - 3 tbsp (optional)

To serve (Per plate)

* Yogurt - 1 tbsp (optional)

* Green Chutney - 1 tbsp

* Tamarind Chutney - 1 tbsp

* Jeera Powder - a pinch

* Chole - 1 tbsp (optional)

* Coriander Leaves for garnishing.

* Chopped green chillies - 1/2 tbsp (optional)

* Namak Paare - 5 to 6 (Deep fried Flaky, crispy salty snack made with plain flour, salt and caraway seeds.)

* Boiled Potatoes slices to garnish. (optional)

* Chopped Onions to garnish (optional)

###**DIRECTION**

Step 1) In a pan add oil and let it heat on low heat.

Step 2)  Now turn on the heat high and Add green chillies and tomatoes. Lightly saute tomato on high flame for a couple of seconds.

Step 3) Now lower the heat and add salt. Give it a light mix.

**Note: This heat adjustment steps help tomatoes get roasted first so that they kinda get the smoky flavor and then on lower heat they can get soft with the salt.**

Step 4) Once tomatoes start releasing moisture, mash them a little with a laddle. Don't completely mash them as we want some chunks as well.

Step 5) Add in dry spices and cook them in Tomatoes' moisture for a minute.

Step 6) (Optional) If you have cooked Chickpeas or Chhole, you can add them at this step. Otherwise skip it, not necessary at all.

Step 7) Now add boiled potato cubes and give it a mix. Make sure you don't mash the potatoes.

Step 8) Now mix in dry mango powder in water and add this to the pan. Cook for 2 minutes on low flame.

Step 9) (Optional) Add chopped onions and Bhujia. Turn off the gas.

Now following measurements are ideal for one serving. If you're serving it for two, then add the equal amounts of toppings and sauces in other serving as well. 

Step 10) (Optional) Add 1 tbsp of yogurt.

Step 11) Add green sauce (coriander and mint chutney)

Step 12) Add Tamarind Sauce (imli ki chutney)

Step 13) (Optional) Add some more chickpeas and chopped onions.

Step 14) Add roasted cumin powder and chopped coriander leaves. You can also add chopped green chillies if you like it extra hot.

Step 15) Add Namak Pare on it and finish off the dish with a bit of tamarind sauce. 

Serve it hot!",71,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/jkbxyw/tomato_chaat_my_take_on_the_popular_street_food/

2020-10-21 14:21:00,submission,IndianFood,"Hare Masale Vala Murgh - Chicken in Spinach Sauce. After 20 years of delicious, I finally made it exactly like the recipe dictates","When I say, ""exactly"", I mean that I finally bought the expensive mustard,  Pommery Moutarde de Meaux (was 25 dollars when I looked in the early 00's, was 12-13 on Amazon) and will describe differences below.

&#x200B;

Hare Masala Vala Murgh

1/2 cup vegetable oil.

6 bay leaves

12 cardamom pod

4 inch piece cinnamon stick

10 cloves

4 dried hot chilis

4 1/2 lbs skinless chicken pieces

1 cup golden raisins\*

3/4 cup plain yogurt

2 1/2 tsp salt

freshly ground pepper to taste

4 inch piece ginger root, coarsely chopped

7-8 fresh hot green chilis with seeds\*\*

2 bunch fresh coriander leaves

2 10 oz pack frozen chopped spinach

3/8 cup grainy mustard, Pommery Moutarde de Meaux\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Put oil in large wide nonstick pan and set over medium-high heat. When  oil is hot put in bay leaves cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, red chilies.  Stir. Add chicken pieces and brown. Put in raisins, stir, put in yogurt,  salt, black pepper and cayenne. Stir and bring to simmer. Cover tightly,  turn to low and simmer for 15 minutes. While chicken simmers put ginger  in the container of blender along with 3 tablespoons water; blend until  it is a smooth paste. Add green chilies and cilantro and continue to  blend. Add lightly drained spinach. Blend briefly. Spinach should have  coarse texture. When chicken has cooked for 15 minutes remove cover and  add green sauce. Stir. Bring to a simmer cover again and cook for 10  minutes or until chicken is tender. Turn chicken a few time during this  period. Remove hard spices before serving.

\*: with all the contrasting flavors in this, the original recipes states 1/2 cup raisins and I have found that using a full cup makes this dish more enjoyable.

\*\*: I've used the green chilis one normally buys at an Indian grocery and I have used Jalapenos when I could not get these.  Also, I've upped the number to 7-8 from the original 4.

\*\*\*: As stated above, only just started using the Pommery mustard, have always just used whatever grainy mustard was at hand.

I've been making this recipe for about 20 years and I must say that it is \*always\* loved by most people I know (except my sister and nephew, who are vegetarian, hate raisins, and hate mustard) and it is \*always\* a leftover I'm excited to eat. I am curious as to how authentically Indian this recipe might be, as I've seen yellow mustard seeds in some Indian dishes but never full-on yellow mustard. Could it be something regional and if so, where?  Any comments from natives about this would be greatly appreciated.

And as for the Pommery Moutarde de Meaux, it's worth it.  When I first made it with regular grainy brown mustard, you could taste how the vinegar and bitter of the mustard nicely complimented the heat of the chilis, the savory/umami of the spices, and the sweet/sour of the raisins and yogurt.  When I first made it with the Pommery mustard, I thought it was good-maybe even a little better-but \*not\* 12-dollars-a-jar better, haha.  But then I made it again \*and\* ate some leftovers of it and there was a toasted nuttiness that the mustard imparted that is significant, pleasurable, and unmistakable in comparison to regular grainy brown mustard.  So now, I may not make this with the Pommery every time but, to impress, wow, and please people I will.  So, maybe not worth 25 dollars, but definitely worth 12.

Enjoy!  


edit: Also forgot to mention that even with the dried chilis and hot green peppers, this dish is somehow not that spicy.  I know people who hate all heat like that and when I have told them how many hot peppers are in the dish, they are surprised.  The heat is still there but, it seems the rest of the dish tempers that heat nicely.",45,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/jfdq97/hare_masale_vala_murgh_chicken_in_spinach_sauce/

* Cook until tomatoes have cooked.

* To make a bhatura, roll out a dough ball to flatten. Get the dough as thin as you can without any tears. Add oil to the dough as needed if the dough is too sticky.
* Drop flattened dough into the frying oil.
* Once the bottom of the dough is cooked, flip the dough.
* Once both sides are cooked, remove and place on a paper towel to remove residual oil.

Ingredients:

Paneer marination:

Paneer - 300 gms/ 0.6 lb 

Maida- 3 tbsp

Corn flour - 3 tbsp

Kashmiri red chili powder - 1 tbsp

Salt - 1 tsp/ as per taste

Ginger garlic paste - 1 tsp

Curry leaves- few chopped (for flavor)

Crushed black pepper- 1 tsp 

Paneer 65:

Oil- 1 tbsp

Ginger chopped - 2 tbsp

Garlic chopped - 2 tbsp

Big onion-1/2 

Green chili- 3 slit

Red chili- whole 5

Curry leaves- few sprigs 

Coriander powder/தனியா தூள் - 3/4 tsp

Jeera powder/சீரக தூள் - 1/2 tsp

Garam masala/ கரம் மசாலா- 1/2 tsp

Kashmiri red Chili powder/ காஸ்மீர் மிளகாய் தூள்- 1 tsp

Red chili sauce- 1 tsp

Ketchup- 1 tsp

Curd/ yogurt/தயிர் - 1/2 cup

Coriander leaves/cilantro- few chopped

Recipe:

\* chopped ginger and garlic into fine pieces

\* cut paneer in cubes and add in warm water to make it soft.

Step 1: Paneer marination:

        In a bowl add all the ingredients under marination section and mix first and then sprinkle water little by little. The marination should not like that for manchurian(thick outer coating) or like fritter/bajji( very thin runny coating) ,it needn’t to be fully covered,as we are again going to toss in sauce.(no need to marinate for long)

Step 2:  Paneer frying

         Heat a pan with oil(add less oil ,as the red color from Kashmiri chili powder discolor the oil) once it is warm,add marinated paneer one by one.  Fry just for 5 minutes,else the paneer lose its soft texture inside.

Step 3: Paneer 65 preparation

        In a kadai or skillet,add oil followed by chopped garlic ,ginger,onion and curry leaves. Sauté it till the onion and all cooked well.

        Add the masala powder mentioned under paneer 65 preparation,(note: flame should be low always when adding dry masala powder,else it get burnt easily and it will be infused in the dish),once the masala is mixed,add the sauces and sauté few more minutes.

       Switch off the flame and add curd.( Adding curd/yogurt in hot pan will led to curdle ,so switch of the flame and add.Mix with masala powder and sauce ). Then switch on the flame, cook in low flame for 2 minutes and turn high, add fried paneer and toss in high flame for just 2 minutes to retain the soft paneer and the sauce are all dried and coated on paneer. Finally add chopped cilantro /coriander leaves and serve it with fried rice or serve as starter with hot soup.

Note:

\* Can also be served just fried paneer and fried curry leaves or Fried paneer and normal tadka or this way.


\*Can also be fried in airfryer by marinating with oil with other ingredients and fry in airfryer in fries mode.

\* Always keep in mind,the longer the paneer in flame,harder they become so fry just for 5 minutes and toss fried paneer in high flame just 2 minutes.",7,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/j9g7c9/restaurant_style_paneer_65/

While I do enjoy a one-pot version of putting vegetables and rice and cooking them together, I really love flavoring the vegetables first, followed by the rice. They looked colorful and tasted fab. Maybe it's because of the occasion? I don't know but here's the [video link](https://youtu.be/Gvjq4HP7d0I) for the recipe below: 

Ingredients: 

2 tbsp oil 

Whole garam masala : fennel seeds 2 tsp, cardamom - 1, cloves - 2

Onion - 1 cup

Potato - 1 cup

Carrots - half cup

Cauliflower florets - half cup

Capsicum or bell peppers - half cup

Mushrooms - 1 cup

Turmeric powder - 1 tsp

Chilly powder - 1 tsp

Coriander/Dhania powder - 1 tbsp

Garam masala powder or Biriyani powder - 1 tbsp 

Salt - 3-4 tsp - added in batches, adjust to taste

Garlic - 1 tbsp

Crushed tomato or fresh tomato - 2 tbsp 

Thick curds or yogurt - 2 tbsp 

Basmati rice - cooked - 2-3 cups 

Pepper powder - 1/2 tsp 

Fresh coriander/dhania leaves - to sprinkle 

Few roasted cashews - to garnish 

In a non-stick pan, add the oil, the garam masala. The onions, potato and carrots go first. After a few seconds of sautéing, add the cauliflower. Once that’s half cooked, add the capsicum and mushrooms. Saute until vegetables are almost cooked. Add the spice powders, salt (only for the vegetables) and garlic. Once mixed in, add the tomato and the curd/yogurt. Mix well. Add the cooked basmati rice, remainder of the salt, pepper powder and fresh coriander leaves. Sauté for a few seconds until the rice absorbs any water from the curd/tomatoes.

2020-08-09 02:09:13,submission,IndianFood,Green chutney issue.,"The first time I made green chutney, it turned out great. Spicy. Minty. Cilantro flavor. The color and texture wasn’t what I was used to, as at restaurants it’s a little chunky and a real bright green. This was leafy and a dark green. But the flavor was good. I added yogurt to thicken it up and it created a great taste. 

I use a Preethi Eco. 

Ever since, something is wrong. It’s always very watery. It has a strong somewhat bitter taste, like too much lemon juice or maybe too much mint or something. Or it’s very salty with almost virtually no salt added. I can’t figure out what is going wrong, but it’s just not turning out. It’s not spicy, sweet, or creamy. It just tastes off.

2020-07-17 19:05:30,submission,IndianFood,Kashmiri chili powder incredibly spicy — bad brand?,"I've cooked with dried whole kashmiri chillies before, and it's been fine. Recently I used [this chili powder](https://i.imgur.com/buM39na.jpg) (edit: fixed link) from an American brand called Deep.

I used in two ways: For a Mexican esquite dish, I fried minced garlic, sunflower oil, and chili powder on low heat for about a minute. (I wanted to use ""normal"" chili powder, but only had the kashmiri lying around.) The final concoction was bitter, and not flavorful at all, and imparted a rather unpleasant flavour to the whole dish. I don't think I burned the powder, but _is_ possible.

Yesterday, I made [this vegetable korma](https://youtu.be/xXQ7YG7H5f8) from the Indian channel Your Food Lab, after seeing it recommended. The recipe called for 4 tablespoons of chili powder to 2.3 dl yogurt; I used just 2 tablespoons, since I wanted to be able to adjust the spice level later. I consider myself a decent cook, and I followed the recipe to the letter, but the final dish wasn't very good (too late I realized I had followed the ingredients _below_ the video rather than the ones in the video, which were very different!), and it was also overpoweringly spicy, which I did not expect.

My understanding of kashmiri chillies is that they're supposed to be quite mild (on par with poblanos, less spicy than jalapeños), and often used primarily as food colouring. I tasted a tiny bit of dry powder on my finger, and it was incredibly, throat-ticklingly spicy. Is this just a bad brand?

It is made with red meat, traditionally lamb or goat and colored and flavored primarily by paprika and chilli. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine.

&#x200B;

**## Video**

[https://youtu.be/eOo8P9ejejE](https://youtu.be/eOo8P9ejejE)

&#x200B;

**## Ingredients**

* 4 tablespoons oil (vegetable)
* 1 small onion (grated)
* 1 tablespoon garlic & ginger paste
* 1 teaspoon paprika powder
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
* 3/4 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1/4 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 2 teaspoons mix powder / curry powder
* 1/8 teaspoon salt 
* 1/4 teaspoon of sugar
* 65 ml tomato paste (with 65ml of water added to mix in easier)
* 250ml of water
* 1 tomato sliced
* 6-8 pieces meat, vegetables, paneer or tofu
* 2 tablespoons cashew paste (see below)
* 2 tablespoons plain yogurt
* 1/4 teaspoon fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi)
* 1/4 teaspoon garam masala powder
* 1/4 cup coriander (fresh/chopped) (for decoration)

&#x200B;

**For the cashew paste:**

place 50g of cashews in a blender to create a fine powder, mix with a little water to form a fairly runny paste

&#x200B;

**## Method**

1. Heat the oil on medium and cook the onions until soft and they are just starting to caramelise

2. Turn up the heat and cook the garlic and ginger paste for around 30 seconds until the bitter smell disappears.

3. Add the salt, paprika, chilli, cumin, coriander, turmeric and mix powder and and cook for a further 30 seconds stirring continuously.

5. Add your choice of meat (I always add my pre-cooked lamb), then add the cashew paste and yogurt (or cream) stirring whilst adding.

6. When the dish reaches your required consistency (and your meat is cooked through if using raw) add the fenugreek and garam masala and stir through.

Ingredients for the chicken curry  

Chicken on the bone cut in medium pieces  \~ 700 gms 

onions \~ 1 large , finely chopped 

tomatoes - 2 , finely chopped 

ginger-garlic paste  \~ 1 tbsp 

Coriander powder - 2 tbsp  

Cumin powder - 1 tsp  

Turmeric powder - 1 tsp  

Mild chilli powder - 1 tbsp or to taste  

garam masala - 1 tsp cilantro  - a handful, finely chopped 

oil \~ 4 to 5 tbsp salt as per taste  

Directions 

To make this simple chicken curry , start by heating oil in a wok/kadhai . Add onions and saute until the onions turns brown at the edges.  This should take about 5-6 minutes. Next add coriander, cumin, turmeric and red chilli powders and cook the spices on low heat until fragrant (abt 30 seconds). Add the tomatoes and sauté it until tomatoes become mushy. It will take 5 minutes for this. Add the chicken and stir well making sure the masala coats the pieces and they seal evenly.cover and cook on medium heat till the chicken is tender. No need to add water because chicken will produce water.add 1/2 to 1 cup of water depending on how much water the chicken has released.cook till the consistency of curry you want. Finally sprinkle garam masala and cilantro and mix. Chicken Curry is ready. Serve thr chicken curry with rice or roti .  

This simple chicken curry is just an idea. You can play around with the ground spices or add whole spices to get the flavors of your liking. Coconut milk or cream or yogurt can also added to enhance the flavor",8,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ho5cmt/quick_and_easy_chicken_curry/

But i can literally go through half a tub at a time - I literally have dreams about Jain  srikhand. When I visit home I usually go and pick it up within the first couple of days that I’m back. 

I figured out a simple way to make it in the west. I discovered a yogurt with 10% milk fat called Cabot. It’s the one I use the most frequently to make this but any Greek yogurt without a lot of whey will do 

Hang the yogurt for about 4 hours in a sieve. You can use a cheese cloth if you like but if it’s Greek yogurt it won’t go through the holes. You basically are trying to get rid of the remaining whey there’s a tablespoon or two hiding in there. 
 
I’m a food processor add in sugar and cardamom. I use about 1/4 cup sugar to 1 cup yogurt but my mother likes more so I up it to 1/3 cup when I’m making it for the both of us. You need about 3 green cardamom pods per cup of yogurt, split them and use only the seeds. 
Pulse this mix till you get icing sugar consistency. 

I mean That’s basically it! Put the hung yogurt in a bowl and add in the sugar and cardamom mix and stir. 

Some notes: if you want it more tart to imitate the taste of european/ Indian yogurt add in one tablespoon of LEMON juice (not lime) 

If you want to flavor or color it add in your coloring into the food processor mix once you have icing sugar consistency - saffron or berries are traditional.

2020-04-12 22:58:51,submission,IndianFood,Do restaurants in India actually leaven tandoor rotis & naans with yeast?,"tl;dr does any one have recipes from chefs etc. what the dough composition is?

I'm experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The post there claims that the bread only contained flour water & salt, no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm understanding a bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just the heat of the tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of yogurt for flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links to videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos are all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay bubbled. [https://imgur.com/JNv9h7A](https://imgur.com/JNv9h7A)  , 

So I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening.",14,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/g06qq2/do_restaurants_in_india_actually_leaven_tandoor/

2020-04-13 11:33:47,comment,IndianFood,,"Almost all recipes online include yeast as an ingredient, and I never like the result. Authentic naan is not bready. It should be a little thick and soft in some places while thin and crunchy in others. I think the recipes online are for the Western variant of ""naan bread"" - which is not at all like Indian naan.

I say this because I grew up in Delhi and I've lived in the US and Europe. I've eaten naan in many different cities across the world, and it is rare to find authentic naan abroad.

I have also tried making naan at home. Recipes that include yeast give you a texture that is better associated with Indian store bought kulcha, but not naan. In fact, store bought pre-made naan is not really a thing in India. Naan is bought fresh from the tandoor.

The recipe for naan has got to be simple given how ubiquitous it is in North India. The smallest roadside eateries make naan in Delhi and Punjab. It's ingredients will be few and cheap. I just haven't managed to get my hands on the right combination yet.

Edit: due to the above, I also don't believe baking powder is an ingredient for naan. It is not widely used in India at all. Baking soda, however, is quite common and might be a possibility.",5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/g06qq2/do_restaurants_in_india_actually_leaven_tandoor/

Maybe used for Kulchas I guess where it is  a bit more thicker. Yeah nearly all recipes in the Internet might have originated from the British Indian cuisine or so, where the naan actually has a flavourful pita bready interior rather than a very thin only layered naan. Atleast phulkas/tawa rotis actually puff up quite a lot without any baking powder/soda, but the heat is probably not strong enough to lock the air bubles in place maybe? So I guess if you do it in a tandoor the bubbles might be locked in place, since the bottom is stuck heavily to the sides of the oven. While in tawas you can't reach such a high air temperature while charring the bottom to simultaneously steam the top.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/g06qq2/do_restaurants_in_india_actually_leaven_tandoor/

Roti and phulka are just different kinds of bread. Both have the same dough and are rolled out the same way. Difference is in hope they are cooked. Roti is cooked in the pan/on the griddle (tawa); roll it out just a little thicker and add a little ghee or oil while cooking and you get a chapati.

2019-11-30 23:22:27,comment,IndianFood,,"Chicken Tikka Masala is not actually a traditional Indian dish. It's an invention of Indian restaurant chefs in the UK who were cooking for the British palette. They took Chicken Tikka (traditional indian chicken roasted in a spice and yoghurt marinade) and added it to a sweet, creamy sauce. I've never had a tikka masala that had chunky vegetables in it. From reading recipes on reddit, I get the impression that chicken tikka masala in America is very different from tikka masala served in British Indian Restaurants. One thing that always strikes me is the number of american recipes for tikka masala where they don't roast the chicken. Oftentimes they just fry it from raw and I would argue this is not a tikka masala, its just a curry. If you fry the chicken in a pan it is not really chicken tikka it will have a completely different texture. Most BIR (British Indian Restaurant) curries are made with onion gravy which is a base sauce made from blending onions and other vegetables. Tikka masala specifically also normally has coconut and ground almonds and is flavoured with tandoori masala. It is a sweet curry so has lots of sugar and is finished with lashings of cream and fistfuls of coriander (cillantro). The ""oily texture"" you talk about is probably Butter Ghee added at the end.

2019-09-14 17:10:09,comment,IndianFood,,"I make yoghurt rice a lot; it is definitely a comfort food. I make it like my mom and grandma always have. Nothing is measured but I’ll guess at amounts for you:

Heat a little oil, and swirl in a pinch each of whole mustard and fenugreek. After a few moments they will crackle. Then add onion (you only need a 1/4 cup or so, but I like using a lot—even a whole medium-sized onion), about 8 curry leaves, and 2–4 slit green chilies (two if using the small, spicier ones; more if using the medium sized, milder ones). Cook until the onions are light golden and everything is fragrant. Remove from heat and whisk in yoghurt (however much you want, but it will season almost a whole 32 oz tub) and salt to taste. Crush the chilies with the spoon to get it spicier if desired. Then mix in rice. It should be slightly loose at first because even  cooked rice will still absorb a lot of liquid after sitting for s few minutes, and this dish is best when the mixture is still moist.

Lastly, you can slightly adjust the above recipe to make yoghurt curry, which you just pour on top of hot rice: use red chilies instead of green, and at the end, instead of turning off the heat, just turn it down and add 1/4 tsp turmeric and a good tablespoon of fresh grated ginger. Cook it briefly, just until the ginger gets fragrant, then remove from heat. You might need to add some water to thin your yoghurt to a pourable consistency. 

I like eating yoghurt rice plain or with garlic or lime pickle. But my favorite side dish is fried potatoes: to temper cumin and curry leaves, then fry potatoes with some salt, and at the end toss with sambar powder. Yoghurt rice is also good with dhal; dhal, rice, and yoghurt is another comfort food so using curd rice is just a more delicious version of that.

The way “Curd rice” is made tends to vary across different Indian homes. Personally, (I’m South Indian) I like to make mine temple style haha. Here is the recipe :)
1. Wash and cook basmati rice until it it is fluffy, either in a rice pot or on the stove
2. Mash the rice with like a spoon until it’s mashed to your liking 
3. Add plain yogurt (plain not Greek lol, some brands I like are “mountain high” and “Gopi”). 
4. Add spices, sometimes I just add salt and asafetida powder, or I also include grated ginger and a temper of spices.
5. Optional: temper your spices. Heat a small pan or stove spoon thing with oil (I never do olive oil as it’s sometimes bitter for me, and I was taught to never mix ghee and yogurt so I don’t feel sick) and add 2-3 curry leaves, mustard seeds, a red chili, and fry until the mustar seeds pop.
If you temper spices I would put it into rice first so the flavor is more enhanced and then add yogurt!
6. Stir together, taste it, and fix the spices or add a really small amount of water so it’s not as chunky.
7. Serve with a spoon of Indian pickle (I LOVE lemon pickle) and enjoy :))",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/d41ktd/curd_rice_lovers/

Then I temper mustard seeds, red chillies, garam masala, hing and Curry leaves, set the flame to low, mix in the rice and curd mixture and cook on low for several minutes until heated through.

For your first time, I would try a less testy recipe and just mix cooled rice and plain curd and add a cooled tempering on top. Start with a simple mustard seed, chilli and hing tempering and add salt and coriander leaves to the mix.

2019-07-23 12:33:48,submission,IndianFood,Palak question,"Hello, My local indian restaurant makes the absolute best palak (spinach) paneer and aloo (potato) veg meal I have ever tasted. Rich, flavorful, savory - pureed to perfection nice and thick, a bit spicy but with lots of herbs and spices. I can't get enough of it ( I would eat it breakfast lunch and dinner if I could) - and yet at $10 for a large (approx 2lbs), and rice is extra, I can't afford to eat it there often as I wish. So I want to try and make my own... I asked them how they make it and they stated they cook the spinach for hours in milk - gallons of milk...and that is all they will tell me. :( I have NEVER heard of this and cannot find any aloo palak recipe out there that cooks the spinach in milk, let alone for hours or for any time. I see a few that add a cup of yogurt--but I am confused.  So I thought i would turn to this wonderful community whom I have learned so much from. Are they pulling my leg hoping to not lose me as a regular crack-addicted customer to their food and just being secretive on their recipe or is this milk cooking real? In the flavors - I swear I taste chicken stock or a chicken base in it--not milk..I got the rest of the spices I can detect--cumin, coriander, ginger, garlic, tumeric, tomatoes, bayleaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon etc.   I would like to know before I go and buy a few gallons of milk to try..I hate wasting food.

2019-07-23 13:16:46,comment,IndianFood,,"I've never heard of cooking spinach in milk either. What I *have* heard of is restaurants putting a ton of heavy cream in North Indian entrees, including palak paneer. Makes it delicious and rich and heavy as anything. Home cooks might put a bit of cream (South Indians would put ghee/butter) but restaurants are in the business of selling you tasty food, so they load it up.

I'm guessing restaurant palak paneer is a masala and onion base plus blanched and drained spinach, into the blender with a bunch of cream and salt, then finished with paneer/aloo/chicken whatever else you wanted.",23,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/cgs18j/palak_question/

That’s the recipe I usually follow, except I blend it really smooth and add way more heavy cream (to my taste) obviously you can sub the aloo for the paneer.

If you are eating for one this makes a decent batch, but the base curry freezes well. Just freeze the purée before adding in the aloo, the potatoes don’t re-heat as nice as fresh. Then you just warm up the gravy and make fresh potatoes whenever you want it.",8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/cgs18j/palak_question/

2019-08-13 20:49:44,comment,IndianFood,,"As mentioned above - posting a picture will really give some ideas. Generally i have seen two kinds served - a palak saag - with distinctly faded green or darker color or bright green one (rare but must try) 

The darker one can use a lot of spices and more its cooked the darker or less green but more brown it gets. This one can be made milder but usually is served bolder with lot of spices. It can be pureed to perfection and strained or more commonly served pureed but a bit thick and chunky. 

The brightly flavored green one tastes more like spinach and uses a very few spices. This we find sensational as ingredients are few and really celebrates the taste of spinach but at the same time is very flavorful. This simplicity though needs some technique. A much undervalued thickener often overlooked is nut purees. They can be almond or cashew. In case of palak paneer, cashew works great as it is much more flavor neutral and in moderation does not take over the palak flavors, i would say more so than heavy cream. Many times we try to add cream to get that rich creaminess but lose on consistency, and answer lies in little bit of soaked cashew cream. 

The spices we used in ours are limited to cumin clove cardamom garlic green chilies and ginger. Main ingredients are just onion, palak and cashews.

2017-09-16 18:09:14,submission,IndianFood,"Help me make flavorful, Chewy Naan","I haven't yet attempted making curries, but I have been making naan to accompany our restaurant take-out and packaged meals. It comes out well enough, but it's not flavorful and chewy like I'd like it to be.

Things I've tried:

* full fat yogurt instead on non-fat (non-fat is what I typically have on hand)
* olive oil or ghee instead of vegetable oil
* adding an egg
* more salt
* garlic
* spice/herb mix
* brushing with butter after cooking

My naan was a bit better last time using all of these changes, but it's still not how I'd like it to be. I'm wondering whether I should find a non-yeast recipe or use only an egg yolk. I'd really like to get some tips.

Here's the recipe I've been using: (from http://rasamalaysia.com/naan-recipe/2/)

* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1/2 c. warm water
* 1 1/2 tsp. yeast
* 2 1/4 c. flour
* 1/2 c. yogurt
* 1 tbsp. oil

EDIT: Okay, so here's what I tried that seemed to help. I didn't want to get really fussy with it, since it's the kind of thing that should be simple. I upped the salt to 2% of the flour content, kneaded the dough more, and let it rise once in a warm place, then punched it down and let it rise in the fridge overnight. It didn't rise much in the fridge, so I took it out and let it rise some more before shaping it for cooking. I'll probably try just leaving it out overnight next time.

I cooked it on a cast iron skillet with ghee. I'm not sure cooking it in ghee really added anything, but the skillet always adds some nice char to the bread. I don't feel like a tandoor or even a pizza stone is at all necessary for this, but either way, I don't have them.

I'm glad I can make tastier naan now. Thanks for all the helpful comments.",43,27.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/70ie2q/help_me_make_flavorful_chewy_naan/

Take a look at the protein / 100g in your flour, you want something >12% (12g/100), there will be an upper limit but the bigger the number, the better for stretchy / chewy breads.

Also, make your own tandoor, it will cost you less than $50, takes about an hour to do and is seriously good fun. Here's mine FWIW: https://imgur.com/a/vP8Og",9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/70ie2q/help_me_make_flavorful_chewy_naan/
2017-09-16 21:13:47,comment,IndianFood,,"Firstly, unless you're cooking it in a tandoor, it's not going to taste exactly the same.

For more chewiness, knead longer and use a higher protein flour.

For more flavour, use salt.

Cook it on a very hot iron pan while blowtorching the top.

Many restaurants simply use self-raising flour, water, and salt. Nothing else.",12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/70ie2q/help_me_make_flavorful_chewy_naan/
2017-09-17 13:07:07,comment,IndianFood,,"Things I would do:

-switch to grams. Cups are inadequate for yeast baking, there is too much wiggle room. 

-use bread flour for chewier results (though in the case of naan I don't think it is strictly necessary, depends on what texture you are after)

-the egg yolk is unnecessary and muddles the flavor imo, most naan don't have it. The bread will also be lighter without a yolk

-since you don't have a tandoor the closest thing you can get is a pizza stone, or lacking that a baking tray used as a pizza stone. Put the pizza stone in the oven at maximum temp for a while (at least 20 min I think) to simulate the higher temperatures a tandoor can cook at. Watch out for food burning.

-for truly professional results, do like professional yeast bakers: use less yeast with longer proofing time. It is what every professional or semi-professional pizza maker does. I am not though. I am pretty sure the principle is universal because it mimics how sourdough acts, while baker's yeast only existed from the last century. The basis is this: use bread flour, take a standard naan recipe, reduce the yeast to a minimum quantity (like the tip of a teaspoon), up the liquids (the dough should be very loose) and let it proof for about one day. You can keep it in the fridge if you wish to momentarily stop or halt the proofing. For this method it is important to weigh the very little quantity of yeast you are using down to decigrams, otherwise your bread will behave in unpredictable ways. The advantages of this method is that, when done correctly, you will have a better product with a less invasive, more complex yeast flavor, it will also be more easily digested. The cons are getting this method to work correctly and, of course, the time spent, though most is inactive. You also need a warm house. Since naan has yogurt in the dough which helps fermentation, the proofing time would probably be sped up compared to a bread without. Professional proofing is not strictly necessary, but when done correctly it will mark the difference between a home baker and a professional.

What I would do is find a good naan recipe and then ask for advice from a professional baker to help you convert it to a professional proofing version.",5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/70ie2q/help_me_make_flavorful_chewy_naan/

I guess it depends on what kind of oven OP has, but especially the pizza stone. I have a crappy oven but with a pizza stone it can cook a pizza in around 5 mins. The problem is pizza stones vary a lot: some are near useless. If this method fails you can still definitely get a nice naan on stovetop, but I can feel the difference.

2016-06-30 17:01:52,submission,IndianFood,"Hi Everyone, I am Richa hingle, author of VeganRicha.com and Vegan Richa's Indian Kitchen","Hi Everyone,

I am Richa from [VeganRicha.com](http://www.veganricha.com)([proof]( https://twitter.com/veganricha/status/748311027989655552)). I am the one person author, recipe creator, photographer on my blog. I am also very active on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/veganricha) (500k+ fans),  [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/veganricha) and other social media channels. My first book Vegan Richa's Indian Kitchen released in May 2015. It is the #1 best seller on Indian food on [Amazon]( https://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Richas-Indian-Kitchen-Traditional/dp/1941252095) since then. 


My book has Indian food made accessible and simplified. It covers dals, veggie dishes, rich curries, flatbreads, savory breakfasts, exotic desserts, celebrating vegetables and legumes. The recipes are inspired by regional Indian cuisines and local ingredients (in the US) , and are streamlined for the home cook. The recipes are also very allergy-friendly with many soy, nut or gluten free options.  I love reading about how people who were previously intimidated are now enjoying their home cookery through the book. 

I always loved my time in the kitchen whether it was making the usual Indian food with family recipes for from scratch hot meals or experimenting with ingredients and flavors. The feedback on the blog and social media encourages me to simplify certain traditional flavors and techniques, be more experimental and creative in developing my own recipes, and to learn and grow as a recipe developer. 

If you are new to the blog, start with [Bombay Potato & peas]( http://www.veganricha.com/2015/09/vegan-bombay-potatoes-and-peas.html)  , [Samosa Pinwheels]( http://www.veganricha.com/2015/11/samosa-pinwheels-spiced-potato-pinwheels.html)  or [Broccoli Pakore Waali Vegan Kadhi](http://www.veganricha.com/2013/05/spiced-yogurt-gravy-with-baked-broccoli.html) recipes.  From the book definitely try [Mango Curry Tofu]( http://www.veganricha.com/recipe-pages/vegan-mango-curry-tofu), [Chickpea Quinoa Lentil spinach Stew](http://www.veganricha.com/2014/05/chickpea-lentil-quinoa-spinach-stew.html), [20 minute Palak Tofu]( http://www.veganricha.com/2013/10/palak-tofu-tofu-in-spinach-curry-vegan.html) .

You can ask me anything about my book or blog, recipes, writing a book, blogging. I can tell you how I do things, not necessarily the best way of doing them :). 

UPDATE: It was great taking your questions. I will continue to answer them later this afternoon.

Because of the preference to North Indian food, the spices and ingredients for North Indian and other similar cuisines are much readily available even in regular grocery stores. So there is that extra step of being able to find the ingredients (only in Indian stores) to cook the dishes which also prevents readers from trying the South Indian recipes.

1. We eat spicier and hotter foods in Summer :). Thats how things were at home. You can make Naan wraps with any of the Mains and a cooling chopped salad. Those sauces taste fabulous hot or cold, so use them any way.  

2.  Curry powder is never used in India or traditional Indian food. Curry powder is less flavorful and has turmeric and other additions that are usually not present in garam masala (which is what I would use). so maybe try a fresh Indian garam masala and see if he likes it?",9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4qmr67/hi_everyone_i_am_richa_hingle_author_of/
2016-06-30 18:33:20,comment,IndianFood,,"With the bread, is the loaf rising well? whats the ambient temperature in your kitchen?

If it isnt rising well, then the dough needs more time to rise or fresh yeast or more moisture, and kneading well.
If it is rising and falling during baking, then the bread over proofed ( rose too much because of warmth or moisture) and hence will fall. 

With the burgers, the patties fall apart if they are too moist/soft inside or, if the patties are too dry with whole unmashed lentils/veggies. For too moist, add more wheat flour or breadcrumbs and pack them really well. For dry crumbly, over cook the lentils a bit and mash the mixture really well and then pack into a patty.  Also chill longer.

All of these added to any dish will make them tastier for our taste buds. Everyday Indian food uses low oil for just the tempering/tadka and is more about the veggies, lentils, sauces. Add more oil to any of those and you should notice the flavor change to tastier. 
2. Depending on the recipe, you can thicken the sauce by cooking longer or adding more of the sauce ingredients like onions, tomatoes, cashew cream etc. 
3. Home cooked Indian food uses fresh tomatoes that are just ripe and not too sweet. Restaurants may or may not use fresh tomatoes. Canned tomatoes, pastes and purees are often too sweet and dominant for traditional Indian flavors and will also dominate the complex spice flavors.

2016-04-20 21:41:58,submission,IndianFood,Help me make my curry better.,"I am addicted to indian food in restaurants.  There are so many things I love when eating indian food but the shining star in my opinion is a good chicken curry.  I have been working for about 3 years to make the perfect curry and I am getting ridiculously close but it's still not as good as when I go to a restaurant.

I am not really a recipe girl.  I will look at a few recipes if I am making something new but just to get a general idea of measurements and I go from there.  So here is a list of general ingredients I use.  My question is, what am I missing?  I am committing any big curry faux paus.  Anything you think would give me a better flavor then what I am currently using?

Onions (usually red, sometimes white or yellow)

Fennel Seeds (from indian store)

lots of fresh minced garlic

fresh minced ginger (sometimes I use the paste)

tumeric (from grocery store)

graham masala (from indian store)

Cumin (from indian store)

Tomatoes (I haven't done fresh yet but I have done cans of diced tomatoes and tomato puree)

Salt/Pepper

Curry Powder (I have like 10 different brands in my cabinet, none of them excite me much, I usually use this if I missing some key ingredient like tumeric or cumin)

Fresh Coriander

Marinade usually goes something like:

Greek Yogurt

tumeric 

cumin

graham masala

fresh minced garlic and ginger

I know you don't see any peppers which is a terrible thing to not add heat to curry but I cook for little ones as well.  So I add heat once it's one my plate with some kind of hot sauce.

So what can I improve Reddit?  I really want to make a perfect curry.

Edit: Formatting

Edit again: forgotten ingredients and clarification

Edit:  So much good advice guys, thanks for everyone's help!!!  I have some work to do.

Found out that a really well-rounded curry needs a tangy element to support all of those great spices.

It really creates a nice base for all of the other flavors and keeps the flavor profile from ""falling flat"" on the tongue. This is especially important in other, more tangy dishes like vindaloo.

It's used in things such as coronation chicken, or piccalilli pickles. ",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4fpq8h/help_me_make_my_curry_better/

I have used chili powder or red chili flakes a bit in the past, that didn't seem to cause any issues I will try some green chilies next time.  My kids are used to those being in like queso dips. So that might be an option.

I have a lot of curry powder, some of it's not even Indian (obviously don't use those in my curries).  I have a few Indian curry powders I got from the Indian store a few from the regular grocery.  They are primary as the other poster indicated mixes of cumin, turmeric, garlic and maybe a couple other things.  I also have some west Indian curry powders and Jamaican curry powders and also some oriental curry powders.  I love spices, lol.

2016-04-21 01:24:39,comment,IndianFood,,"Definitely. When I think of the kinds of dishes non-Indian's refer to as ""Currys"", I can imagine that if they only have cumin, turmeric, garam masala and fennel as the added spices, they're not going to have that robust flavor profile. 

You want to start by lightly toasting bay leafts, cardamoms, peppercorns, cloves (forgot to mention these) and cinnamon in oil. That establishes the base. As they toast gently, they infuse the oil with their flavors. Just by smelling it now, you'll be able to get that restaurant feel.

Then you typically also want to brown your onions before proceeding, to establish a nice deep and rich, almost caramel flavor. Next you'd attack the ginger and garlic, and you want to cook off the raw garlic smell and then proceed to chuck in your canned tomatoes. (Please try to pick canned tomatoes that are very low on sugar, otherwise that just doesn't sit well in the overall equation.) 

With this, you have a nice base to build on. Different dishes will involve different proportions, but really you can't go wrong after creating this base to have a ""curry"". 

Your Garam Masala tends to be added in three stages. I, personally, enjoy Garam Masala added in the middle of the cooking process, so that it isn't too overcooked and a light bit in the final stages.",10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4fpq8h/help_me_make_my_curry_better/

2015-01-08 06:50:02,submission,IndianFood,Keema-mattar reconaissance - I added too much yogurt!,"Hi all!

I had never had any desi food other than chicken curry until about two years ago, and I've loved the flavours ever since, I didn't realize Indian and Pakistani food had so much depth to it. I've since tried some daals and even pakistani barbecue recipes, but today was my first hand at a stovetop protein... and it went terribly. 

I followed a friend's recipe for Aloo-keema+mattar (Mince with potato and peas), where towards the end (before the addition of the peas), it called for a cup of yogurt to be put in and reduced down in the mince. I was a bit skeptical as I haven't put yogurt in meat before... but you know new cuisine, tried to follow verbatim. I'm usually no slouch in the kitchen so I wasn't too concerned as long as I followed the recipe but it just didn't pan out.

After over an hour of reducing, this cup of yogurt was clearly way too much for the mince and hadn't reduced down to the 'right' colour/dryness still. Is there any way for me to get the mince dried of this over-addition of yogurt? Should I perhaps add water to dilute the yogurt a bit and then reduce on high heat? I'll of course remove the potatoes so they don't turn into full-on mash first. I was advised to cook the night before so the flavors 'settle' in so I won't be serving it until tomorrow. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!

Update: I did put it back onto the stove to see if it'd dry up a little more but to no avail. Next time, I'll use a bit more cooking intuition and a little less to-the-T instructions for Indian recipes. It seems to be a bit more of an intuitive cuisine.

You can checkout here:
http://www.peppergarlickitchen.com/quick-easy-chicken-tikka-biryani/

**For chicken**

* 500g Chicken
* 4 tbsp yogurt
* 1 tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp red chili powder
* 1 tbsp coriander powder
* 1 tbsp chicken tikka masala powder
* 1 large onion
* 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 tbsp ghee or oil
* 2 green chilies
* Coriander & mint leaves
* ½ cup milk
* Saffron strands
* Salt to taste

**For Rice**

* 500g Basmati rice (flavored long grain rice)
* 2 black cardamoms
* 3-4 green cardamoms
* 1 bay leave
* ½ inch cinnamon stick
* 1 tsp caraway seed (use cumin if not available)
* 3-4 cloves
* 1 tsp ghee or oil
* 1 tbsp salt

Instructions
Thinly slice the onion and fry till golden brown. Take brown onions out of oil and spread on kitchen towel to drain excess oil. We will use these onions later.
Start with marinating the chicken. Clean the chicken and make slit on chicken pieces with a knife so that the marinade goes well inside the chicken.
Transfer chicken pieces in a mixing bowl, add yogurt, half of the brown onions, cumin powder, coriander powder, red chilli powder, garam masala powder, salt and lemon juice. Chop handful of coriander, mint leaves and green chillies and add to the mixture. Add the mixture well. Don’t hesitate to use hands. Keep it aside for half an hour.
While chicken is marinating soak the rice for at least half an hour.
When chicken is marinated, start with rice. Boil two cups of rice, add black & green cardamoms, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, caraway seed, cloves, salt and ghee or oil. When water is boiled add rice into it. Keep close eye on rice, take it off the flame when rice is 80% and drain excess water. Make sure rice is not over cooked.
Now we start with assembling chicken with rice. Put a heavy bottom pan on medium flame. Add 1 tbsp ghee or oil and transfer the chicken with all of the marinade. Let it cook till water dries out. In the meantime, soak saffron strands in milk. If you like more colour, add pinch of saffron food colour as well in milk.
When water is dried from chicken, add a layer of half of the rice over the chicken. Spread coriander and mint leaves and brown onions over this layer. Place rest of the rice over this layer. Again spread remaining brown onions, coriander and mint leaves. Spread milk & saffron over rice. Also add lemon juice. Add remaining oil by the sides of the pan. Cover the lid of the pan.
Heat a heavy bottom skillet over low flame and place the pan with chicken and rice over it. Let it cook for around 30 minutes. Switch off the flame and let it rest for 5-10 additional minutes before opening the lid.
Garnish with some fresh coriander and roasted nuts while serving.",26,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/2rm8ya/the_super_amazing_chicken_tikka_biryani/

At Indian restaurants, things are a little shakier. Many places that are trying to appeal to the American/Western palate add lots of cream or butter to many dishes for texture/flavor/richness, even if they aren't ""traditionally"" used. So you'd have to ask.

In non-Indian places, it varies heavily. Amy's is a brand that I can easily find in most supermarkets (e.g., Walmart, Harris Teeter/Kroger), and Trader Joe's has their own brand of Indian frozen foods. In some areas where the grocery stores are smaller or whatever, you might not be able to find anything like this, though.

There is a dish I have had a number of times in different restaurants that always blows my mind. I get the impression it is a fairly common dish, as I'm usually able to find something like it with enough trial and error wherever I go.

Whenever I ask about what's in it, I always just get a curt ""it's yogurt sauce with spices."" English isn't my first language, so I'm usually reluctant to push the issue, lest it get awkward fast. 

Anyway, it's not raita and it's not the yellow mint yogurt stuff. 

It is thick and yellow, usually served over pakoras or roasted cauliflower. It definitely has some sort of strong, sour yogurt base with a pungent, roasted spice taste. I THINK I detect coriander, though I wouldn't swear it. It does NOT have what I normally think of as a standard ""curry"" flavor. No mint, no cumin.

*2 tablespoons fresh garlic paste

*1/4-1/2 tsp red chili powder (depending on how spicy you like it)

*salt, to taste

*1/4 tsp haldi (turmeric powder)

*1 tsp cumin seeds (zeera)

*5 cups water 


In a bowl, combine besan and yogurt. Whisk well, until no lumps remain. 

Pour mixture into a pot. Add water, garlic, and spices. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 1-2 hrs. When finished, set aside.

For the pakoras-

*1 c. besan 

*1/2 c. water

*½ tsp baking soda 

*1/4 tsp turmeric 

*1/4 tsp red chili powder (optional, or you can use a finely minced green chili instead, if you like it super hot) 

*1/2 a small chopped onion 

*1/3 cup chopped cilantro 

*salt to taste

Mix together ingredients for pakoras, let sit for about 20 min in the fridge. Fry pakoras in small batches and drain on paper towels. Add them to the kadhi.

Make a bagaar (what you use to temper the kadhi) by heating a little less than 1/4 c. oil, and then frying 1/2 a small onion (thinly sliced), a pinch of brown mustard seeds, 5 or 6 curry leaves, and dried chili peppers until fragrant.

It can most definitely be boring but when cooked with intention and care, it can be an endlessly flavorful and variably healthy product. 

Recently I’ve been using it in my daily power bowl. 

- 3 generous scoops of TJs honey Greek yogurt

- a relatively large helping of high fat ground beef (sometimes ultra lean depending on my goals/activity for the week) roasted in my Yellowstone skillet with baby corn & seasoned generously with salt, pepper (OR sometimes old bay)

- a good smattering of TJs spicy taco sauce. (Not every time, only when not using old bay or when I’m not eating fully clean)

Initially, this was just an efficient way to pack protein and get key nutrients. Then eventually I started taking care with how I cooked the beef.

2025-07-11 17:53:35,submission,Food,[Homemade] Tarragon Chicken with Herbes de Provance,"Rounding out my herb garden I finally grew French tarragon this year. It has a lovely, delicate flavor with hints of anise, vanilla, and pepper.

So here is my very first dish made with it all! I feared it might be too floral, but it was lovely with a perfect balance of flavors. 

Having added savory to my herb garden two years ago, I realized that I had all of my own herbs to make Herbes de Provance and used that as the base (though a bit heavier on the tarragon).

You'll note this isn't a ""traditional"" French recipe, as I'm trying to watch my calorie intake, so I used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of lots of cream and butter. 

**Ingredients**

* 3-4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs 
* 1-2 teaspoons salt
* 1 tablespoon oil w/ high smoke point
* 1 onion (or 2 large shallots)
* 8 cloves of garlic 
* 1 cup of white wine
* 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon 
* 3-4 tablespoons of fresh Herbes de Provance (terragon, thyme, rosemary, sweet basil, oregano, savory, lavender) - less if dried
* Black pepper
* Lemon juice and/or zest (to taste - depends on the wine)
* ⅓  cup of non-fat Greek yogurt

**Instructions**

1. Season chicken with 1tsp of salt (reserving the rest)
2. Heat stainless steel skillet on high (or 5-6 for our induction stovetop) 
3. Put oil in pan and roll to coat
4. Put chicken skin-down in pan and cook until skin is crisped
5. Set chicken aside (skin-up to keep it crispy)
6. Turn down back to medium 
7. Add black pepper and onion/shallots and cook until soft with flecks of browning 
8. Add garlic and cook until you’re scared you’ll burn it 
9. Add in white wine and deglaze the pan 
10. Add in Herbes de Provance and chicken bouillon 
11. Add lemon juice and salt to taste
12. Return chicken to pan, skin up, nestled in the sauce
13. Cook until chicken temperature reaches 165f, turn off stove and remove chicken
14. Stir in Greek yogurt until smooth 
15. Place sauce in serving dish and lay chicken on top 
16. Decorate with fresh tarragon and lavender  ",63,5.0,https://i.redd.it/bazdhp8y8acf1.png

2025-03-04 20:20:09,submission,Food,[Homemade] Lamb & Fondant Potato w/ Creamy Chimichurri,"Would you baa-lieve how easily this lamb-orghini of flavors comes together? 🤣

For the creamy chimichurri:
1/2c Olive Oil
1 Bunch Parsley
1 Red Chili
1tbsp Balsamic Vinegar
1 Head Garlic
1/2 Shallot
1tbsp Oregano
Salt & Pepper to Taste
Greek Yogurt as needed to make it creamy, can also use sour cream

The fondant potato takes the longest so we'll start there with browning both sides in a very liberal amount of butter. After browning, add onion, garlic, thyme, a red chili, and chicken stock for basting. Cover & bake at 400° basting every 10 minutes until it's tender, 30-40 minutes.

The lamb is a simple SPPOG rub and then cooked in butter. Sear, flip, sear, then sear the sides at a slightly lower temp until cooked through. You can also sear it then finish it in the oven with the potato.

Serve with creamy chimichurri and to look fancy, a little shaved parm and parsley 😂

I recently experimented with a **new way to make extra crispy fried chicken** and I HAD to share! Instead of using breadcrumbs, I coated the chicken with **instant oats**—it gives an amazing crunch and a super satisfying texture! 

# 🥣 Ingredients:

* Chicken wings/legs
* Greek/plain yogurt (for extra juiciness)
* Instant oats (instead of breadcrumbs)
* Salt & pepper
* Cooking spray or a little oil

# 🔥 How to Make It (Super Easy!):

1️⃣ Season the chicken with salt & pepper, then coat with Greek yogurt.  
2️⃣ Cover & refrigerate for 2 hours (optional, but enhances flavor!).  
3️⃣ Coat the chicken with instant oats instead of breadcrumbs.  
4️⃣ Air Fry at 380°F for 30 minutes – Flip at 15 minutes & spray lightly with oil.  
5️⃣ Done! Super crunchy outside, juicy inside, and perfect for any meal.

Anyone else tried using oats as a coating before? Would love to hear your thoughts! 😊🍗

2024-11-01 16:01:01,submission,Food,[Homemade] Tandoori shrimp skewers,"Recipe:
1st Marination:

Shrimps: 1 lb
Pinch of salt 
half lemon juice (its 1/2 tsp or 3/4 tsp around)
Mix them well and let it marinate for 10 to 15 mins. It's just the first so 10 would be even enough.

After marination 2ND One: (I will write down what can be substituted and what you can do to make it better)

Any tandoori marination most important thing is: 
Yogurt: 3/4 cup (to make healthier can use low fat one)
Ginger garlic paste: 2 tsp ( do not worry if you don't wanna do it just chop things up and put it in)

Take a bowl add mustard oil 1.5 tbsp (if do not then peanut oil or any kind of little flavor oil would be better do not use olive or avocado oil that will make it taste bitter cause we need to heat the Shrimps on high)

Then add following spices adjust according to spice levels: Red chilli powder 3 tsp, turmeric 1/4 tsp, cumin powder 1 tsp, coriander 1 tsp, garam masala ( you can skip this one if you want) 1/2 tsp, Pinch of rock salt, pepper powder 1/4 tsp and that's all.

Mix all the things well and then add the first marination Shrimps to it and done. You can keep the marination for 2 days and you can cook after 30 mins of 2nd marination getting done or right away either is OK.

Grilling them would be best option.
If you don't wanna spend time on oven just don't even skewer it and add to a grilling pan and add little oil high heat little and boom done. That is my preferred method.",46,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gh8u5r

2 tbsp. Walden Farms Chocolate syrup (0 calories but can absolutely be replaced with something else)

1/4 cup 1% milk

Mix it all up with a spoon and eat by itself or on something like toast or rice cakes or what have you. Tastes good, high protein content, and pretty low calorie for the volume. If calorie count needs to be higher I'd use creamy peanut butter, whole milk, and brown sugar.

2015-12-06 07:37:25,submission,Food,"Medicinal food? - my superfood, supersmoothie ""elixir of the tree of life"" recipe.","Backstory

Where to begin.. a number of years ago when i was suffering from obesity and type 2 diabetes, total loss of energy, depression, sleep problems, all the usual stuff that happens when you've lived a sedentary lifestyle for many years, a friend of mine's GF recommended that I get on a weight loss meal replacement program for which she was a distributor, and she assured me that i would lose weight and have more energy, so i placed an order, but that was just the beginning of what's become a type of hobby of mine. After doing a little research and by trial and error, i began a type of quest in search of the ultimate superfood, supersmoothie, one that tastes great, is totally satisfying, and is filled to the brim with a vitamin-mineral-nutrient profile that's perhaps as good as can be had anywhere on God's green Earth, so i figured it might be helpful to share it here. 

Be forewarned that the entire list of products can be rather costly to pull it all together, but, once you have an accumulated stock, keeping it stocked up doesn't cost too much more than ordinary food on a month to month basis. You can't put a price on good health and well being, so in my opinion and based on my experience, it's well worth the investment. 

Please note that this is not a sales pitch or advertisement for any particular product or products. I am not a distributor or salesman for any of the products listed. Ok, here we go.. 

To start with, for the protein powder and vitamin-nutrient supplement ""base"", I've found that nothing beats the taste, texture and consistency of a Mediterranean formula called Pure Trim (powder) and Daily Complete (vitamin-mineral-nutrient liquid), found [here](https://www.puretrim.com/) (you'll be amazed at what's in those two products alone). To try to cut down on costs, I've tried replacing the Pure Trim (Vanilla) with other powders, like brown rice powder, whey isolate, etc. but i've simply not found anything that's as satisfying in taste and texture for the base of my smoothies. 

with that in hand for the base of the smoothie ""build"", I'll provide a list of the various things i use, then i'll describe how i make it, then maybe touch on the experience and benefits from taking it, as it's as much a medicine as it is a food in my experience. 

1) One packet Pure Trim powder.

2) One ounce Daily Complete (each bottle lasts for about a month)

3) Requires one high performance blender, with a fairly large container. I got mine, a Black and Decker, ""Performance Fusion Blade"" on sale for $119.00 at Canadian Tire, normally $256.00

4) Bananas (good source of vitamin B6 and a good source of manganese, vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber, potassium, biotin, and copper.)

5) Greek yogurt (I like vanilla flavor) it's considered a superfood

6) Pineapple (an excellent source of vitamin C and manganese. It is also a very good source of copper and a good source of vitamin B1, vitamin B6, dietary fiber, folate, and pantothenic acid.) I just used the cheap canned chunky to make it easy, and the juice is tasty. Once i started using pineapple, then went without, the taste just wasn't the same, so not i stock up on it and it's cheap.

7) Frozen berry mixture - I guy one large bag of frozen berries called ""Europe's Best"" along with a few smaller bags of frozen strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and cranberries, to keep the big bag stocked as it helps reduce costs a little bit.

8) Pure Virgin Coconut Oil - one tablespoon. I melt it in a little bit of hot water. contains Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) – which are fatty acids of a medium length. Coconut Oil Can Improve Blood Cholesterol Levels and May Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease. Coconut oil is loaded with saturated fats, which actually do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously thought. Saturated fats raise HDL (the good) cholesterol and change the LDL cholesterol to a benign subtype.

9) Bottle of Water - liquids go in first, then powders, then soft foods, then hard foods, then ice.

10) Ice Cubes - I drop in about five large cubes on top, then pour the hot water virgin coconut oil on top to hear them crack, just for fun. 

ok, now here's where it starts getting a little more costly.. 

11) Greens powders

I use two mixes, one greens, the other a berry extract powder combined and other superfood powders, each of which I've put into two large plastic containers that I keep in the fridge, although i may end up getting a third container for additional superfood powders with a high [ORAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity) count (antioxidants), like Camu Camu, Maca Root, sprouted Chia seeds, Hemp Hearts, Ashwagandha powder etc (there's about 20 of these exotic superfoods to choose from). 

for the greens, i start with a greens powder product like Progressive Greens or Brad King Wild Greens, something of high quality to get my greens powder supply going. Then i'll add to the greens mixture, which really fluffs it up and gives me a supply capable of lasting me for months and months (you just use a tiny scoop of this stuff), the addition of Spirulina powder, and Chlorella powder, which are blue-green algaes (vary dark, very rich and very green). Then to top off my green powder stock, I add a product called [Sunwarrior Ormus SuperGreens](http://www.sunwarrior.com/store/ormus-greens.html). I ordered the plain but they sent me the peppermint flavor, which is good as it takes away the pungent bitter-green taste and makes it more palatable (I don't even detect any peppermint flavor though). I order it from well.ca and comes in a large 1lb 454 g bag, which is huge, so given that i only use a tiny scoop for each smoothie, it lasts a long long time. All this green powder is shaken up in the container and stashed in the fridge. To further add to the green-ness factor, i also add a dropper of a tincture called [Ocean Greens Sea Vegetables](https://well.ca/products/abundance-naturally-oceangreens7-sea_97143.html). One bottle, at about 40 bucks lasts a couple of months.

12) Berry extract powders. In the second container, I dump in a product called [Progressive Phytoberry](https://well.ca/products/progressive-phytoberry-antioxidant_65210.html), to which I'll add and mix in some other stuff like Goji Berry powder and Acai powder, and [Bee Pollen](https://well.ca/products/purely-bulk-bee-pollen-granules_50622.html) which, thankfully is cheap. 

13) I add a tiny bit of a mixture of two mineral compounds, in a powder form, called Etherium Gold and Aulterra from a company [Harmonic Innerprises](https://www.harmonicinnerprizes.com/products/natural-monatomic-minerals/) for good measure. If you have the dough, in addition to that powder mixture, you could add alchemically formulated M-state elements (Ormus or Orme) from a lab company called [Zero Point Technologies](http://www.zptech.net/), but it's like 65 bucks a gram. I'll eventually add a gram of that to the two ounce mixture of the other two powders just to see what it's like.

The possibilities, and budget overruns, are obviously endless. Right now i have on order a [5 Mushroom Blend Superfood](https://well.ca/products/wild-rose-5-mushroom-blend-super_85348.html) and a Red Reishi extract tincture (some samurai dude once ate everything in the forest he could find and somehow without killing himself discovered this king of the mushrooms which has extraordinary medicinal properties, particularly for the heart and liver). 

This post is getting a little long so i'll wrap up now. 

Directions: throw everything into the blender, blend, and then partake of the elixir of life, while thanking God for the ability at this time in history when the superfood fruits of Earth can be consumed in a single drink, and to have access to such an extraordinary medicinal food supplement. 

Results? 

There are hardly even words to describe the feeling in the mind/body/spirit when you take this stuff in. What you end up with is increased eyesight, and what can only be described as a physical and spiritual experience that goes with you for the whole day. It will lift your mood, give you all the energy one could need, with better focus, concentration, stamina, emotional and mental control, and what i can only describe as a smooth and loving heart. It's unbelievable! I've just been back on it for about 2 months now and already the grey is leaving my goatee - I'm serious. Ashwagandha btw, contains a substance that can actually repair the telemeres of DNA replication ie: reverse aging. Want smooth skin? This kind of thing will make your skin as smooth as a babies bottom. Have you reached middle age and feeling a little dragged out and tired? Want to feel like a kid again? This is it. 

I hope this has been helpful to someone, and that you'll enjoy a happier and longer life as a result. 

God bless you!  

P.S. Please don't flame me or make fun of me for sharing, as my only interest here has been to share something of great value that i think may benefit a lot of people if they were to take up this ""hobby"". You'd have to eat your way through a roomful of fruits and veggies to get half of the vitamins, minerals and nutrients in a blender of this stuff. It's so potent in fact that you could just supplement with it every two or three days to severely cut down on the costs involved (probably adds up to about 7 or 8 bucks a shake). It will change your life and make you feel like a kid again. Add to this a simple exercise regimen, and your family and friends will be utterly astonished that you've dropped 10 or more years off your appearance. It also dramatically increases the enjoyment, taste and satisfaction, and digestion, of regular food. 

Enjoy!

2014-05-15 19:27:51,submission,Food,Seasoning your Fish,"When I first started cooking fish, I had no clue what to put on it. I guess you could say this sushi loving girl was clueless. But I had to start somewhere! I asked a lot of my friends for their favorite seafood recipes and their favorite way to prepare fish. I wrote them all down and started experimenting in the kitchen. You know what I found out? Fish is pretty versatile!


There are several different ways you can season fish, but today we’ll start with the basics.


SALMON – Great with dill weed, fennel seed, and lemon zest. And if you like spice, you could always add chili pepper or curry powder combined with garlic. Salmon is the meaty fish, so strong flavors are do-able!

 TROUT  - Great with spring like spices and herbs;onion, bay leaves, cayenne, cilantro, orange zest, and shallots. My favorite combo is cilantro and orange zest!

HADDOCK – Another white fish that is great with fresh herbs. Haddock also pairs well with Indian spices like garam masala and turmeric. You can season your fish with these Indian spices then add a little fresh yogurt on top!

SCALLOPS- Scallops are one of my favorite to season. You can make them buttery by sautéing in butter with garlic or onion, or you can bake in a chicken broth with a bit of parsley. Simple and delicious!


So you see, seasoning your fish can be quite easy. All you need are the right spices and a fresh piece of fish!

Cheers,
Lindsay

2012-12-01 11:39:24,submission,Food,What's your favourite fast food? I want to hear from people all over the world!,"Hi Reddit,

I was watching a PBS special about America's favourite sandwiches and found it interesting that there were so many different types of fast foods that I did not know about. I am a glutton and love that kind of food! I want to hear about what people in Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Asian countries etc enjoy! Comments from the USA will be most interesting I believe. 

Give me your local delish, special that people from other town/country would not know about too! Links, videos and articles are welcomed to be shared ;) 

I'm from Bulgaria so our local fast food kind of sucks... I mean the traditional types. What we have is basically called ""Banitsa"". Good to stuff your face in when you're really hungry and a cheap substitute for breakfast. It's oily and basicallya flour-egg mixture that is thinly spread and spred with chese on layers. 

Our local fast food drink is called ""Airan"" (it's a Turkish word so probably popular in Turkey too) - this is yogurt mixed with water. I like adding sugar, but usually you just add a bit of salt.

Also there is something called ""Boza"", taken from wikipedia the explanation goes as "" It is a malt drink, made from maize (corn) and wheat in Albania, fermented wheat in Turkey and wheat or millet in Bulgaria and Romania. It has a thick consistency and a low alcohol content (usually around 1%), and has a slightly acidic sweet flavor."" Also popular in the region and Turkey. 

If you're not really into fast foods, I would be interest to hear also what would be your favourite way to ruin your diet? :)",23,71.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/143m8d/whats_your_favourite_fast_food_i_want_to_hear/

2012-09-27 00:39:10,submission,Food,"I've never tried some very common foods (fish, Alfredo sauce, Mexican food).  Help!","EDIT: Attempting to get bullet points to show up properly.  Hope this works... 

Alright food, I have a confession to make.  I am almost 29 years old and I haven't tried most of you.  I grew up in suburban Philadelphia and my parents never really exposed me to a wide variety of foods.

Until a year ago, I pretty much ate unhealthy pre-cooked and other prepared foods.  I bought my own place and have lost a significant amount of weight.  Through this process, I have attempted to expand my palette a bit and eat healthier/expose myself to more things.  However, the more things I try, the more that I realize there may not be any hope for me - there is a lot of stuff I don't like.

There are certain foods that I don't know anything about, so I'm not even sure where to begin with them.  Standing in the store tonight looking at the 10 varieties of tuna available (I had no idea!) for about half an hour made me realize that I need to ask for some help.  This is where you come in.

Every time I go shopping, I've resolved to add at least one new food item to my list and try it.  There are some things I've already tried, some things I have yet to try and other things that I'm reluctant in trying because I am not sure about what to get or how to prepare it.

Things I've never tried:




* Avocado/Guacamole - I've put these together on the list because, from what I understand, they are the same thing.  Please correct me if I am wrong here.  What do I do with an avocado?  Do I just slice it up and eat it like a watermelon?
- Crab - I know I could always order this, but I don't want to spend that money and end up not liking it.  If someone else ordered it, I could ask to try a little bit - but I've never been out with someone who has ordered this.  This is something I have no idea what exactly I should buy, how to prepare it properly and, if prepared, how to eat it.
- Lobster - Same as Crab.  Need help on what to buy, how to prepare and how to eat.
- Mexican Food (Taco Bell doesn't count, right?) - I don't even know where to start with this.  Where do I go, what do I order or what do I buy and how do I prepare it?
- Fish - I've always been afraid of getting sick from fish, but I realize that is probably a ridiculous fear.  I don't even know the varieties of fish.  It overwhelms me so much that I've put it out of my mind.  Help on this topic won't be ignored.
- Alfredo Sauce - I've had pasta and red sauce, but never had the Alfredo sauce.  I don't really need any advice on this one, but if you had some knowledge to share, I would take it.
- Peppers - I don't even know where to start with these.  Holy crap, I'm pathetic.
- Tomato - I've had tomato products (ketchup, red sauce, etc), but I don't think I've had an actual tomato.  Do I just buy one and bite into that shit or what?
- Lettuce - Okay, I've had this before, but it was when I was really young and I didn't like it.  So, I now avoid it.  I have a feeling that I would like it if I tried it again which is why it is on this list.

Things I've tried for the first time over the past year:



* Thai Food (Pad Thai and Curry Chicken) - I was able to stomach the Pad Thai, but didn't enjoy it. Hated the curry chicken, just don't like that spice.
- Chinese Food (Ton of Stuff, can't even remember it all) - the only thing I liked was Sweet and Sour Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.
- Cottage Cheese - I liked the flavor of this, but I was only able to get one bite down as the chunky texture of it grosses me out.  Just thinking about it triggers my gag reflex.
- Tapioca Pudding - Same as the Cottage Cheese with the texture.  Triggered my gag reflex almost right away.  I actually thing this may have ruined regular vanilla pudding for me now.
- Yogurt (Chobani Strawberry and Blueberry) - I have never been more on the fence about a food item before.  At times, I thought it was okay, but other times I felt like I was forcing myself to eat it.  I ate the 4 that I bought before they went bad, but I am not exactly itching to try it again.  Do people really enjoy this or is it more of a ""I should eat it because it is healthy"" thing?
- Cucumber - completely bland taste, but it was just a slice of raw cucumber.  No idea if I am supposed to prepare this or what.  I don't exactly hate the flavor, but I am not dying for that taste again.
- Potato Salad - I didn't like this.  I can't describe why that is, I just... ick.
- Hot Sauce - It was on some kind of a spicy chicken sandwich.  It didn't make me sick, but it sat in my stomach heavy - felt like I had just drank a cup of syrup.
- Onions - These have snuck into various food items throughout the years and I can't eat any of them (you guessed it, because of the texture).  I will give them a legitimate try from time to time, but it is just overbearing and disgusting.
- Wheat Bread - Yes, I seriously just tried this for the first time a few weeks ago.  It is REALLY good.
- Canned Tuna - I really like this.  I just opened the can and dumped it in a bowl and it is damn good.  What else can I do with tuna?  As I said earlier, I was so overwhelmed in the store by all of the varieties.  What is the difference between the light tuna and the albacore?  What about  in oil or in water - is one better than the other?
- Mayo - Love it.  I now can't eat a burger without it.  Should I try Miracle Whip now?
- Pistachios - Yes, these are REALLY good.  Just bought another bag of them.

There are a few things that I've attempted to try, but I just can't do it.  I've had them on my plate and tried to lift them to my mouth, but just doing this has triggered my gag reflex.  If I were to try them, I know I would lose my lunch:



* Clams
- Sushi
- Sardines
- Shrimp

This may be hard to answer since you don't know what I have and haven't had, but is there anything missing that I should add to this list?

Some of these things may very well blow your mind.  I know - I'm pretty embarrassed about it myself.  However, ANY tips, ANY advice, ANY questions, ANY answers, ANYTHING is greatly appreciated.",6,43.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/10jczg/ive_never_tried_some_very_common_foods_fish/
2012-09-27 01:30:31,comment,Food,,"Your avocado:  Take it, mash it up in a bowl with a little bit of very finely chopped garlic, some diced tomato, lime juice, salt and pepper.  This is guacamole.  Avocado is just the vegetable, which is delicious on sandwiches, and good on salads, tacos.


Not very well versed with crab or lobster, but fish is great; super healthy and versatile.  Dip it in egg wash, then seasoned bread crumbs, and pan fry it.  Make a batter and deep fry them (I don't know the quantities, but recipes are easily found online).  Cook them in the oven with some tomato, black beans, and seasoning.  Cook salmon on the grill, on a flank of cedar wood.  Lemon is such a common thing to put with fish, and is so good.


*Mexican food:*

  While I don't know too much about it, the basics aren't too hard.  For tacos, brown some hamburger in a pan.  Drain excess fat, then add some cumin, chili powder, and water.  Simmer until water is mostly gone.  Serve into taco shells with tomato, lettuce, cheese, salsa and sour cream.  I don't know enough to explain how to make your tortillas or taco shells.  

For quesadillas, cook some chicken or steak, seasoning to your liking, and slice it thinly.  In a pan, lay a tortilla down (over medium-low heat), and top with your favourite toppings; the chicken, onion, tomato, black beans, and cheese.  Either add another tortilla on top, or fold in half.  If you add another one on top, be sure to flip it.  This can be done by laying a plate over the pan and inverting, then just slide the quesadilla back into the pan.  I don't know too much else about mexican cooking, enchiladas are delicious, many simple recipes online to follow.


*Alfredo sauce*

Very important!  If you're making your own, be sure to keep it over Low heat, and keep an eye on it.  Too hot, and you'll curdle your milk / cream, and the sauce will be ruined.  I made this mistake.  Just take care of it and make sure it doesn't get too hot.


*Tomato*

I'm not a big fan of that, but some people love slicing it and eating it like that.  Make a sauce, or chili with them! Slice them, put them in a sandwich, in a salad, etc.


*Cucumber*

Perfectly fine to eat like that, with a little salt and pepper on it.  Chop into a salad.  Make a salad with that, tomato, onion, and some cheese.  Put it into sour cream (or greek yogurt) with some lemon, salt and pepper, for a tzatziki sauce.  Good in sandwiches, wraps, or as a snack.


*Tuna*

Mix with mayo, salt and pepper, celery and green onion, for an easy tuna salad.  Eat with crackers, or onto bread and make a sandwich.  I'm not sure about albacore vs the other, nor the oil vs water.



Do Not go to miracle whip! It's sweet, very strange, nothing like mayonnaise at all.


Not a fan of clams, though I've never really tried them.  I love sushi, but it took awhile to get used to it.  Now I'm getting into more raw varieties.  Try some with cooked fish, nothing abnormal about that.  


I'm not very big on cottage cheese or tapioca pudding either, but everyone has their own tastes.  Hot sauce can be alright if used properly, and isn't too spicy or strong.  Onions are SO versatile, in just about anything.  On their own they're less appetizing, but can seriously help elevate just about any dish.  Well, maybe not elevate, but provide a base on which to build.  I love potato salad, but again, everyone has different tastes.  Love chinese and thai food as well.  Try blending some yogurt with berries (just buy frozen if not in season), a banana, and a little milk or juice for an absolutely delicious smoothie.  Super healthy and tastes great too.



Remember, there's no reason to be embarrassed, you should be proud that you're venturing out there and trying new things; many people would not do that.  The only way to learn is to try new things, and figure out your likes and dislikes, nothing to be ashamed of.

2012-09-27 05:44:51,comment,Food,,"Just a warning about avocado. If you get the ""Hass Avocado"" variety, which in my opinion is the best, do not eat it when it is green. It should be almost black and firm to the touch but not mushy. If you push on it with your finger it should resist at first but then go in. Then you know its ready.

I usually mash it up and spread it on a burger like mayonnaise (its nickname is nature's mayo because it is so rich and creamy). I don't recommend guacamole (which is mashed avocado dish) because of your texture problems with onions and possibly tomatoes. Avocado by itself has very little flavor, but it will need some salt on it or lime juice to bring it alive if you put it on a burger.

For fish...The real intro should probably be something palate friendly like fish and chips or fish fingers (which are smaller and usually a lot more crispy/breading). Look for mild white fish such as cod, haddock, tilapia. Stay away from salmon at first because it has a very oily feel and can be fishy.  I know you had some concern about getting sick from fish but if you open the cooked fish up you should smell nothing except the spices or flavoring. If you smell ammonia send it back (and I would choose another meat that night). And don'y buy fish on mondays.

If you like tuna...I prefer the pouches rather than the cans. The texture holds up better and has less smell. Look for Albacore chunk or solid white for the most palatable kind.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/10jczg/ive_never_tried_some_very_common_foods_fish/
2012-09-27 01:09:19,comment,Food,,"Based on your reaction to texture avocados might not be something you enjoy. Guacamole is avocado with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, lime juice. You can buy it chunky or smooth. Avocados have a very mild flavor. Great on sandwiches, burgers, with eggs, mexican food, in tuna salad... 

Peppers are awesome. Bell peppers have no heat but great flavor. Poblanos and anaheims are mild too. Jalapeños and Serranos pack heat but have a great flavor too. Commonly used in salsas, stir frys, chili...anywhere you want spice really. Stuffed jalapeños are awesome. 

I could go on and on about food but due to your texture issues and possible sensitivity to spices I don't want to mislead you. If you have cable try watching Food Network or the Cooking Channel. Maybe pick up a cooking magazine for ideas or shoot, how about a cooking class? 

I think your approach of a new item a week is good. You're off to a good start it seems. Oh, my other tip is to keep trying the same foods even though you didn't care for it. Your palette can change, mature as you continue your food journey. Also, try to eat what's in season and what's local as it will taste better, fresher.

2012-09-27 01:34:39,comment,Food,,"When I moved out, I started finding recipes online I thought I might enjoy and had a ""weird food night"" once a week. I tried something new once a week and followed a recipe. Found out about different kinds of foods. Some were great, some were a flop. Just keep an emergency pizza in the freezer in case it doesn't turn out.

Canned Tuna - this is pretty versatile. I like tuna in water better, but it's all a matter of taste. Albacore tuna seems to taste less ""fishy"" to me, but I usually buy whatever is cheapest. 

Since you said you like mayo, try mixing a drained can with a tablespoon of mayo, and a tablespoon of mustard (if you don't like sour things, omit the mustard and add more mayo). Spread on some of your wheat bread. You can go nuts and try adding slices of tomato and some lettuce to complete the smammich.

Tuna is also good if you crumble some drained stuff in a salad with a vinaigrette dressing. 

Miracle Whip - This is like mayo with some garlic, lemon juice, and vinegar. It makes it more of a sour taste. I was raised on miracle whip, but I like mayo now that I'm an adult. 

Onions - To get the taste without the texture, you can always add onion powder. I have a sensitivity to onions, but for some reason the powder doesn't upset me. I always keep some around.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/10jczg/ive_never_tried_some_very_common_foods_fish/

If you like cheese, you can make a tuna melt, just put a slice or two on the tuna, stick it in the oven at about 300 degrees till the cheese melts.

2012-09-27 18:22:26,comment,Food,,"I might be a bit late to the party, but just wanted to throw in a couple suggestions of my own. My favorite way to eat tomatoes is in bruschetta. It's very simple to prepare, although it is best with fresh basil, which can be a bit expensive. You can find recipes for it pretty easily on google, although I'm not finding anything quite like the way I learned to make it. Let me know if you're interested in my recipe.

And since everyone's giving out their tuna salad recipes, here's the way my mom taught me. I use regular tuna in water, drain it well, and mix in mayonnaise and pickle relish. I like putting it in a sandwich with lettuce and sliced tomato, and sometimes a slice of cheese. I generally use romaine lettuce, but you might want to experiment a bit to find what you like. I like to eat this well chilled, with chips on the side.

You might also want to start picking up some dried or fresh spices, as these can add a lot to your cooking. Garlic salt is a miracle flavoring for savoury dishes. Fresh garlic is also good to have on hand, as is dried garlic powder. I would also recommend chili powder or red pepper, Italian seasoning, and maybe parsley, oregano, basil, and/or cilantro.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/10jczg/ive_never_tried_some_very_common_foods_fish/
2012-09-29 23:52:09,comment,Food,,"Avocados:
There are a ton of different ways you can make guacamole, but my favorite is simple, mash the avocado with a fork until creamy, sprinkle in some sea salt or kosher salt (avocados definitely need salt), squirt a little fresh lime or lemon juice in, grate a little shallot in and a shot or two of tobasco and stir it all together. Takes two minutes to make and is delicious!

You can also use them mashed and salted on sandwiches ... I often use them in place of mayo on the bread.

Or since you like tuna, try this: use a fork to separate the tuna in a bowl, dice one or two stalks of celery, dice a kosher dill pickle, add some mayonnaise (not miracle whip, but Best brand or Hellmans), some Dijon and some fresh ground black pepper. Stir it all together. It's great served in a halved avocado (sprinkled with a little salt before you put the tuna in).

For the cucumbers try adding a little sea salt. Avoid the iodized salt it tastes bad. 

Have you tried red bell pepper and green bell pepper? Again if you eat them just plain, try adding a little sea salt.

Try a salad with the following: arugula, halved grape tomatoes, diced ripe Haas avocado, some chopped italian parsley (not the curly parsley), sprinkle with sea salt and add some lime juice and extra virgin olive oil...toss together. Try some feta cheese too and if you like it, toss some of that in. Or try some fresh parmesan cheese gratedvin with a vegetable peeler. This is also great with grilled ciabatta bread torn into pieces and thrown in. Just olive oil some sliced heavy crusted bread, like ciabatta and grill on both sides on medium or so. It grills up quickly so don't walk away. When it's just off the grill rub a peeled clove of garlic over one side a couple of times, ti will melt on their and is delicious.

For clams, lobster and other seafood make sure you are getting it from a good seafood market. Clams should be alive just before you cook them or eat them. To test you lightly tsp them on a hard surface and they will close up, any that remain open when you do this, need to be thrown out. After they are cooked any that don't open (and some can take awhile) should be discarded as close well. Do not try to pry open a clam that remains closed and has already been cooked.  To cook clams I like to add a little olive oil and/or butter diced celery, and chopped shallot to a stock pot and sauté a little bit, add some minced garlic sauger a bit more, add some dry white wine, and the well rinsed and cleaned clams, bring to a simmer with lid on and check frequently removing clams as the shells open. You'll have a concentrate clam juice which you can strain if needed and use to dip them in or use as a base for a seafood pasta sauce... The juice freezes.

For lobster. I like the East Coast or Maine Lobsters. Steam them in a couple of inches of water salted to taste like the ocean, you steam with lid on a large stock or lobster pot for 8 to 10 minutes for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs. You can look on Legal Seafood website for cooking times of other sizes. Served with warmed butter or clarified butter. Simple and so amazing. 

If you are interested in trying sushi or sashimi, and are buying the fish from a market, buy it from a fish market and make sure anything you eat raw is sushi grade from a reliable source. Typically you don't need to worry too much in clean reputable restaurants.

A wonderful way to prepare fish easily that keeps it moist is En Papillote (steamed in the oven in parchment paper). If you are interested I will type out a recipe for salmon made this way.

It's terrific that you are open to trying new foods!!! Have fun!!!! :)

PS Ina Garten has a delicious roasted shrimp recipe, that's easy. I just make it without the sauce.

On to the Salmon en Papillote:

This is a fun dish because you can make it in individual servings for as many people as you like. This is for a single serving: 

Find a good fish market and buy a nice salmon filet 6 ozs or so, skin on is fine, you will need to have the fish monger remove the pin bones for you, or you can take it home and remove them yourself with a pair of needle nose pliers. Rinse the salmon off, so there are no scales. (I live on the West Coast and  like Wild Caught Alaskan King Salmon, but buy what is available and you can substitute other fish also)

Preheat oven to 350°. Rack in center of oven.

Cut a 10"" piece of parchment paper, fold it in half with a crease and cut 1/2 a heart shape out of it - open it so it looks like a heart

Julienne 1/2 a zucchini or yellow summer squash (or 1/2 and 1/2 of both)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmefj-FRKoQ (note: you do not need to peel the zucchini or the summer squash)

Clean and slice a tablespoon or so of 1 leek into thin half moon slices … 1 white portion with the pale green of the leek is enough for several servings. Here is how to clean and cut leeks (which because of the way they grow are very gritty, so this step is important) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8glwRaS8OM&feature=related (note: let the grit settle to the bottom of the bowl you are soaking them in and lift them out, leaving the sand in the bottom, you may wish to rinse again, dry them off with paper towels or flour sack towels (you can bleach them to clean them)

Zest an orange and use just a few pinches of the zest and you'll use about a Tablespoon of the orange juice from it

Place the leeks and the zucchini (and squash) on one half of the parchment paper. Place the salmon filet skin side down on the vegetables. Salt the salmon and add fresh ground pepper as well.

Place a slice of butter (not margarine) and a little of the orange zest and then drizzle the orange juice and if you have it a little dry white wine over the salmon. This liquid will actually steam the fish when it is enclosed in the parchment paper.

You will fold the parchment paper around the fish starting on the rounded side and ending at the point on the bottom… http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWh4K1sieM

Place on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or so, remove from oven and look to make sure fish is cooked to your liking. Remove from paper and serve over rice, pouring juices on the rice. Or serve in paper on dinner plate. You may wish to remove or eat around the salmon skin - I like it though. 

If you do give this a try, let me know how you like it! :) 

I have a few other thoughts on fruits and vegetables for you to try as well as thoughts on yogurt and a great granola recipe that adds some crunch to the yogurt, which may make it more interesting for you. I will send those separately.

2012-09-30 05:18:44,comment,Food,,"It seems like you are really trying to eat healthy foods so...
A few thoughts on fruits and vegetables:

Tomatoes: 

Whole fresh tomatoes should not be stored in the refrigerator it makes them mealy. Once they are cut, you should store them in the refrigerator.  I love grape tomatoes because I can control how many I use and not cut more than I can eat. Tomatoes need salt (and pepper!) If you get a mealy one, toss it. Don't let a bad textured tomato turn you off to them. Romas are good for sauces, the vine tomatoes for salads and I like the grape ones because they are convenient and easy to cut open exactly what you need for a small portion. I have them sitting out constantly and use them every day. Heirlooms are delicious and if you are at a farmers market grab a few! If your tomatoes start to go on you, sauté an onion, some garlic in olive oil and add the tomato (diced) with some basil and or thyme and a little white wine and or/butter… instant quick sauce for fish or pasta that can be refrigerated or frozen. There are a ton of ways to add more body and flavor, but this is quick and simple.

Onions:  
Do not refrigerate, unless cut, and even then realize, once they are cut, they will get strong, which may be why you don't like them. Don't cut too long before you need them. I use shallots for a lot of things because they are smaller and milder. However onions are great for stocks and soups. I go easy on raw onions on almost everything and usually add just prior to serving, so they don't overwhelm the dish. When onions are sautéed in olive oil over low to moderate heat for a long time (30 minutes to an hour), they caramelize into a really beautiful sweet yummy base for soups and stocks.

Mushrooms:
If you haven't try these sautéed in butter and/or olive oil with a little fresh thyme is good too! To clean brush them off or use a damp paper towel to get the dirt off, if you wash them they do get water logged and tend to leech liquid. When you cook them, don't salt too early, they will get soggy. Also, add Shitakes and Cremini to your try list. You will eat only the caps of the Shitakes. The stems are too woody to eat but are great in stocks, When selecting the Cremini or white button mushrooms, make sure the stem and the cap do not have separations between them… you should not see the gills underneath the cap.

Fruit:  
Many fruits do better not stored in the refrigerator unless they are already cut. Although it lasts longer in the refrigerator, it  can affect the texture (peaches and nectarines for example). If you want to serve the fruit cold, put it in the refrigerator prior to serving leaving enough time to chill it. Grapes, definitely belong in the refrigerator though! And berries seem to too.

Mango:
If you haven't tried mango, try it! It has a sweet and early flavor and is a gorgeous color. It's great in salads, and can go with salty or sweet dishes. Ask your produce manager to help you pick a nice one and show you how to slice it. The seed is stringy and flat, so it can take some getting used to, to cut around. They are easy to peel with a potato peeler (OXO brand works well) I lived on the East Coast for years and didn't eat mangos that often. They are plentiful year round in California and I am completely addicted.

Pomegranate:
The seeds are great! Cut it in half and eat the seeds fight out of it, or sprinkle on salads. They're a mess but worth it! And they are in season now!

Asparagus:
Have you tried roasted asparagus? It's not exactly the season right now, but when it is, give it a try if you haven't. Here is one quick, easy way to prepare it. Again, have produce manager help you select some good asparagus. They should tell you what to look for. Make sure it's firm with tips nice and tight and the bottoms not too dry looking. Preheat oven to 500°. Take a couple of pieces from the batch and snap off the bottoms. They tend to naturally break where the woody part starts. Use these pieces as your gage to just whack off the bottoms of the rest and discard. Line a baking sheet with foil, toss the asparagus in olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt  (or sea salt - I like kosher though, because it's a larger grain and adds texture). Place on highest rack and roast several minutes until you notice the skins blistering a little. Asparagus should be tender but not too soft. 

These should be a good start ;)

Also regarding yogurt:
Yes yogurt is good and no it's not just for health, though it's a nice bonus. A couple of thoughts… I eat Chobani too. To me it's good, but I also like one called Siggi with no added fruit so it is more creamy and still sweet. Try some of the other Chobani flavors like: Pomegranate, Blood Orange, Passion Fruit, and Mango. Also, try sprinkling some granola in it for texture and crunch! Here is a good recipe for granola from Alton Brown. I keep it simple by using just the oats and almonds with the salt and replace the oil with grape seed oil, the honey with coconut nectar (doesn't taste like coconut - tastes more like molasses, and the brown sugar with coconut sugar - tastes like brown sugar). I substitute because it is supposedly lower glycemic and healthier. Here is his recipe: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLWh4K1sieM

Well… that's all for now.  My apologies for any typos, I am typing fast and furious. It's wonderful you are interested in exploring other foods, broadening your horizons and it sounds like eating more healthy! That is awesome… Wishing you many new, interesting, fun, and delicious food experiences. :)

2012-09-27 11:20:31,comment,Food,,"Anything, really.  But they are usually simply spiced, not a bunch of chili powder and ground beef is never used in Mexico.  Carne Asada, grilled marinated steak, is probably the most common, at least with Gringos.  Adobada(or al pastor depending on the part of the country) is wonderfully flavorful pork that has been roasting on a trompo or vertical spit, which is my favorite.  Cabeza is slow cooked beef cheeks, and are amazing as well.  
Tacos typically consist of a freshly made, griddled soft corn tortilla, the meat of your choice, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Many will add guacamole as well.  Hard shell tacos- tacos dorados, are typically regional specialities, but they don't really resemble the Americanized taco.
Also, depending on the region, you will find specialities, such as fish tacos in Baja, Birria del chivo- slow roasted goat- in Sonora, ants and grasshopper tacos in Mexico City.

2012-09-27 11:33:51,comment,Food,,"I'm not sure if you can truly find authentic tacos in Philly.  But I will ask some of my friends!
Tacos are typically served on the street in Mexico- think hot dog stands or small fast food restaurants.  They resemble nothing like a Taco Bell taco, or what most Americans probably assume a taco is.  Usually, freshly prepared corn masa is griddled to make a soft tortilla, then your choice of meats(and it's never ground beef), onions, cilantro, salsa(which is paired with each meat), and many places, guacamole.  
If you plan on trying it, I would suggest carne asada, which is just marinated grilled steak diced into small pieces.  That is the safest for most people's comfort level.  It is very common for tacos to be made out of brains, intestines, lymph nodes, tongue, etc.  All can be pretty darn tasty though, should you ever feel adventurous. 
If you can move past carne asada, (or pollo asado- chicken), I highly recommend adobada(or al pastor-same thing). It's marinated pork that roasts on a vertical spit all day.  It's like barbecue pork.  Or carnitas, which is slow braised pork cooked in it's own fat, then usually crisped up.  Kind of like pulled pork.  Or a fish taco, Baja style.

2012-06-09 08:25:28,submission,Food,Looking for a Chef MacGyver,"So... I work at a hotel all night, been doing it for years. There's a small kitchen here where they do the breakfast stuff. But I can only eat cereal and yogurt and waffles every night for so long. So, I'm looking for some help. Looking for some interesting dinners I can make in the kitchen here, given the limited ingredients. I *could* obviously bring food from home (and do most of the time), but I think it'd be much more interesting to see what you all can come up with to make with just the stuff that's already here in the kitchen. Here's a list of everything I can use:

White bread sliced,
Wheat bread sliced,
Mini bagels,
Pastries w/ fruit jelly,
Frozen cookie dough

Fruit loops,
Cheerios,
Corn flakes,
Instant oatmeal (regular, maple brown sugar, apple cinnamon)

Hardboiled Eggs,
Liquid egg mix (ie: eggbeaters),
Bacon (precooked, stupidly thin),
Sausage (precooked, no casing)

Oranges,
Apples (red),
Bananas

Yogurt cups (strawberry, strawberry/banana, rasberry, peach)

Whole milk,
2% milk,
Half'n'Half

Orange juice & concentrate,
Apple juice & concentrate,
Coffee, ground (not instant),
Tea (orange pekoe cut black, individual tea bags),
Bottled water

Pancake/Waffle dry mix,
Instant mashed potatoes (powdered)

Butter,
Vegetable spread (ie: icbinb),
Cream cheese,
Granulated Sugar,
Mayo,
Yellow mustard,
Ketsup,
Jelly (grape, strawberry, mixed berry),
Pancake syrup,
Salt and Pepper,
Honey,
Hot sauce

Kitchen Tools:
Fridge and Freezer,
Microwave,
Convection oven,
Cookie oven (small convection oven),
Coffee maker,
Waffle maker,
Toaster,
Chafer,
Various utensils,
Parchment paper,
Cookie sheets,
Rectangle steel pan (about 10""x12""x2""),
Ceramic plates,
Tin foil,
Plastic wrap,
Mixing Bowls

Here's an example of something I tried once... I make an ice cream out of half'n'half, sugar, and strawberry jelly. At the time we also had cinnamon toast crunch cereal, so I made a pie crust from crushed cinnamon toast- ice cream pie. Didn't turn out too good... turns out some strawberry jelly wasn't enough to flavor the ice cream and make up for no vanilla (though with some tweaking I could probably make it taste better).",4,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/usygn/looking_for_a_chef_macgyver/

2010-12-03 21:53:11,submission,Food,My Super-food Super Breakfast,"Hello Everyone,

   I have recently started paying more attention to the health of my meals. In the process I have come up with what I call my Super-Food Super-Breakfast. 


The following are the ingredients for the base of my breakfast. I usually make this every Sunday and it will last me the entire week.


**The Base**

* 1 Cup of uncooked Quinoa (Results in 4 cups when cooked)

* 1 Cup of Plain Almonds 

* 1 Cup of Walnuts 

* 1/2 Cup Crushed Flax Seed

* 1/2 Cup Sunflower Seeds

* 1/2 Cup Hulled Hemp Seed


[Here is the Wolfram Alpha nutritional information for the base (minus hemp seed)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4+cup+cooked+quinoa+%2B+1+cup+plain+almonds+%2B+1+cup+walnuts+%2B+1%2F2+cup+sunflower+seeds+%2B+1%2F2+cup+flax+seed&a=UnitClash_*cup.*CupsCanadian.dflt--&a=*DPClash.ExpandedFoodE.walnuts-_*Walnut.dflt-&a=*DPClash.ExpandedFoodE.sunflower+seeds-_*DriedSunflowerSeedKernel-&a=*EAC.ExpandedFood.SunflowerSeedKernel-_**SunflowerSeedKernel.*Food%3ACookingMethod_Food%3AToasted.Food%3ASaltContent_Food%3AWithoutSalt--.dflt-)


**To make:**

Cook the Quinoa (I always use a rice cooker), when finished combine with the other ingredients. I usually put the almonds through a food processor and try and crush up the walnuts for more even distribution.  I then store it in a tupperware container in the fridge.


**To make breakfast**

* 1 Cup of the Base Mixture

* Small handful of Raspberries

* Small handful of Black Berries/Strawberries (depending on the season)

* Larger handful of Blue Berries

* A few dollops of Plain Natural Organic Yogurt



Notes: I use berries because they are low in sugar and I try to watch the sugar intake. I also use the Natural yogurt to keep the sugar content of this down to a minimum. For some people the taste of Natural yogurt might not float their boat so you could try flavored yogurt. Also you can use whatever fruit you would like I hear banana's go really well with the mixture. 


I can't say for sure if its true but I find that this gives me an instant energy boost in the morning. It leaves me feeling full and from what I can tell is very healthy for you. Lots of good essential fats, complex carbs, and whole proteins.

2009-08-22 01:51:05,submission,Food,"I'm a foodie on a much-needed diet.  I'm pretty good in the kitchen, and here's how I'm sticking to my diet.  Rabbit food need not apply!","I never realized quite how fat I was getting until I saw a few photos recently taken of me.  To be quite honest, I was disgusted to look at myself.  I decided to lose some weight.  My goal is 145-150 lbs - where I was in prime condition.  That goal is 80+ pounds lower than my starting weight (236 pounds).

Now, I've tried dieting in the past, and frankly, that rabbit food shit just doesn't catch my interest.  I need real food.  Filling food.  Tasty food.

Fortunately, I am the son of a trained chef (graduate of the Culinary Institute in NJ) and part of an Italian family that loves to cook.  Growing up, I received a great training in the kitchen.

Previously, my eating habits were far from healthy.  I was consuming about 4500-5000 calories a day, with a diet that consisted mostly of fast food while at work, and fried food and high carbs (lots of pasta and rice) while at home.  I was on the fast track to becoming morbidly obese.

With a great deal of support from friends and family, I started on a diet.  My best support on this has been my father, who survived a heart attack two years ago, and was recently diagnosed with diabetes, and thus was forced into an ultra-healthy diet.  Additionally, I have several friends with home gardens that are more than willing to share their harvest with me.

The first thing I did on the diet was buy a bicycle for the exercise part (and when it got too hot/humid to bike outside, a friend of mine gave me an exercise bike that she was no longer using).  Once that was taken care of, it was time to alter my diet.  I managed to cut my caloric intake from the previous 4500-5000 calories a day to only about 1000 calories a day.  How?  Read on.

First, I cut most red meat out of my diet.  With my love of beef, that was quite difficult, but I did it.  I do still eat beef every now and then, though (about once a month).  Second, I decided to try and learn a new cuisine - one that I hadn't developed a style with.  I started learning Asian food - mostly Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai.  Japanese is of particular interest, as it's long been considered one of the healthiest cuisines on the planet.

I started making a lot of stir fries, loaded with veggies, and using a lot of chicken and seafood for proteins.  I also started learning how to make sushi, which has since become a large part of my diet.  After the first couple of weeks on the diet, I started adding in a re-learned Mediterranean cuisine - lots of baked salmon, a little pasta, Caprese salad, fresh veggies, seasoned and spiced just right, and other goodies.

Now, I'm eating some of the best food I've ever made, but still managing to remain around 300 calories per meal for lunch and dinner, and under 150 calories for breakfast (typically a low-cal, no fat yogurt, and a piece of fruit, with coffee).  I also have cut out the chips/popcorn/soda, and now have snacks that consist of fruit, and beverages that are either water, flavored water, or low-calorie Gatorade.  Overall, I'm only consuming about 1000-1300 calories a day.

Between the healthier diet and the added exercise, I've lost 12 pounds in six weeks (exactly on track with a healthy weight loss regimen).  I'm still eating like a king.

This foodie is happy, healthy (or getting there, at least), and still enjoying his food.

Now, a question: who would enjoy seeing recipes for the healthy, yet tasty food I'm eating?",78,92.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9czei/im_a_foodie_on_a_muchneeded_diet_im_pretty_good/

What I want to know is: where do you find the willpower? If you were consuming 5000 calories a day you were probably eating to the point of sheer exhaustion and constantly snacking throughout the day. How do you deal with not having that sense of fullness and not having something for you hand and mouth to do?

2009-08-22 13:07:42,comment,Food,,"I'd like to offer you hope from the other side of the struggle;  I used to weigh 225 pounds and dropped to 150, a good weight for my height.  It took about a year and a half, and the regimen is very similar to yours; light breakfast, veggies, fruit, chicken.  The key was to avoid processed food and keep the preparation in my house to a maximum.  I will say from experience that 1000-1300 calories in your diet is OK, as long as you monitor yourself closely.  But, remember, if biking or working out is a big part of your weight loss, at least eat some extra calories in the form of protein.  150 calories of whey protein will give you 24g of protein.  You could even double that as you get more hardcore.  The extra muscle will speed the loss of fat and maintain your progress.

A couple months after my diet hit, I forgot all about fast food and began to abhor anything unhealthy.  I began running, keeping to a minimum of 25 miles a week spread out, as well as any other physical activity I could engage in (mowing the lawn, swimming in the ocean...).  Whatever gets you sweating burns off calories.

A few years later, I am now at 160lbs, and find it difficult to always find the time to eat right and work out, having a full time job, a part time job, night classes and a new daughter.  But the healthier eating habits I have developed, plus a penance for working out when possible if not always regularly have helped to keep my weight stable.

But having gone back up to 175 before raising the alarm, I've got to tell you, it's a life-long struggle, especially for those of us who need to eat sprigs while a skinny friend eats bacon burgers.  Some people will insist that you lighten up and go out to eat with them.  Very, very occasionally, they are right, but peer pressure is a huge obstacle to real weight loss.

Anyways, I'd love to see your recipes.  Best of luck to you, and give reddit a follow-up post in a few months!  Oh, and take some before and after pictures before you lose anymore weight.

Chicken, pork, tofu, beef, shrimp, whatever you've got works.  Mushrooms of any sort are a good addition, and I alwyas like bamboo shoots, maybe water chestnuts.  Green onions are always good.  Snow peas if they're in season and you can afford them.  Mung bean sprouts.  Onions, lots of onions, I love onions.

Truth told you can basically just drop in whatever you've got handy.  The only real essentials are:

Ginger.  A stir fry without ginger is flat and bland.

Garlic.  Lots and lots of garlic.  Garlic works with the ginger to really make a good flavor.

The sauce is as variable as the stir fry itself.  The central ingredient is soy sauce, of course.  To that add a bit of mirin if you've got it.  Tabasco sauce makes a nice bit of extra zap even if it isn't traditional.  Vinegar or wine.  Black pepper.  If you don't have or can't afford fresh garlic, add garlic powder to the sauce mix.  Vegetable or beef broth depending on your taste and the other ingredients.  And finally a bit of corn starch to tighten things up.

I also like a bit of fish sauce in there, but that's more of a South Asian rather than East Asian flavor and may not be for everyone.

2009-08-22 07:49:40,comment,Food,,"Making a good stir fry without spending a load of time requires a few things, in order of importance:

1. You need a really, really hot wok. This requires two things. First, you need a wok that can get really hot, and that means a carbon steel wok. Second, you need something that can heat this wok up; Your kitchen stove won't do. Get an [outdoor burner](http://www.grainandgrape.com.au/images/outdoorburner01.jpg).

2. Know the cooking times of all your ingredients and stagger adding them to the wok.

3. Invest in a good knife. A quality knife will literally shave off 50%+ from your stir fry prep time from a dull one while giving you control and safety. Each vegetable should take seconds, not minutes, to prepare. Get a R.H. Forschner if you're on a budget, Shun if you're not, or a Kyocera Kyotop if you're rollin'.

4. Umami it up. Soy sauce, fish sauce, crushed anchovies... make sure your stir fry has at least one of those.",8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9czei/im_a_foodie_on_a_muchneeded_diet_im_pretty_good/

Unless you're one of those people that can slice an entire bell pepper into thin slices in a matter of seconds (like professional Asian chefs can), it'll often take 30 minutes or more to prep the veggies.

This extended prep time can be made less lengthy by using defrost times for other ingredients to prep the other ingredients - such as slicing the peppers and carrots while the chicken breasts are thawing in the microwave.

I do strongly recommend using only fresh fruits and veggies in your stir-fries, though, and strongly recommend locally grown fruits and veggies from your local farmer's market, as almost everything is ripened before being picked, and thus far more flavorful.

I know that here in Maryland, while having a particularly rainy spring/summer, we're having a bumper crop of huge, flavorful fruits and veggies.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9czei/im_a_foodie_on_a_muchneeded_diet_im_pretty_good/

2009-08-22 06:45:24,comment,Food,,"1000 calories is way too low for a person over 200 pounds.  It is a crash diet, no matter which way you slice it.  The fact that he is getting lots of vegetables probably helps, but as Aleut mentioned a person doing this would feel like crap due to lack of energy, proper vitamins etc.  Of course it is entirely possible that the 1000 calories is purely an estimate and he could easily be eating double that every day and still be losing two pounds a week.  

The numbers really just don't add up in reality.  If this person really were eating 4500 calories a day and was maintaining his weight then dropped that number to 1000, he would be losing a pound a day (3500 calories = one pound of fat).  Combine this with an hour of exercise, which is easily 300 calories at a moderate intensity and that is beyond starvation.  So basically if the numbers were correct this person would be pushing ten pounds a week, not healthy and likely not even possible. 

When I was studying nutrition we had these great charts that allowed you to tally all your daily activities, weight, etc. and find out how many calories you needed exactly to maintain your weight.  [This page](http://primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/library/weight/calsburned.htm) will get you in the ballpark.  The OP should be eating roughly 2760 calories daily to maintain his weight with a sedentary lifestyle, no exercise.  In order to lose two pounds a week with no exercise you are looking at 1760 calories per day.  I have a feeling that the actual calories ingested by the OP both before and after are closer to mine than his estimates.

I recently commissioned her to make a custom piece of clothing for me.  She offered me 20% off of the cost if I was able to lose 50 pounds (she's so loaded up with orders, it'll be nearly a year before she can get to mine).  Considering that what I ordered was over $600, a 20% discount is huge.

I did a good bit of research online before setting my dietary limits.  I'm certainly not a dietitian - I'm a fat foodie.  I found a calorie estimate to maintain my ideal weight (145-150 pounds) of 2300 calories a day.  After finding that out, I set my initial calorie intake at 1500 calories a day, figuring that the rest would be burned from fat, particularly assuming I keep up on the exercise regimen.  After starting the diet, I found that I was able to keep myself from feeling hungry with smaller meals, more often, and with more veggies than I had previously.  Frankly, a 16 ounce steak provides about 500-1000% the needed daily intake of protein, along with roughly 300% the healthy value of fat.

Because of that, I'm eating a lot of white meat chicken, pork chops with the fat trimmed off, and a ton of seafood (fish, shrimp, and clams, mostly), mixed with large amounts of fruits and veggies.

I think the flavor of the stir fry should be judged more from the flavor of the ingredients, versus the flavor of the sauce.  I do come from a background of fresh foods, and flavors from the fresh foods (Italian/Mediterranean), and feel that the fruits/veggies/meats should provide most of the flavor.

Personally, I've always hated when my veggies taste more like the sauce than they do like themselves.  When I do stir fries, the sauce is added right at the end, as a seasoning, except for when I'm doing rice noodles in the stir fry, in which case the veggies are added at the last minute, and remain crisp in the stir fry.",7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9czei/im_a_foodie_on_a_muchneeded_diet_im_pretty_good/

2009-08-23 02:23:06,comment,Food,,"Sorry, should have been more specific on the method.

Stir fry, really, is a method much more than its a recipe.

As a general rule you will get the best results if you cook the various ingredients mostly separately.

Brown the meat (if you're using meat) first, then set it aside.

Brown and sautee the mushrooms (if you're using them), set them aside.

Same for onions.

Then toast the garlic, add the ginger and start in on the veggies.

Veggies you can cook together, but you'll probably add them in batches from the longest cooking to the shortest cooking.  Broccoli, if used, should be last (along with snow peas, or any other veggie that wants a brief steam rather than a real cook), for example.

Once the veggies are mostly done, add the stuff you've set aside, toss to combine, then finally dump in the sauce.

The sauce is constructed separately, in a bowl or similar, and added as everything is mostly done.  Keep the heat on long enough for the corn starch in the sauce to thicken things a bit, and then serve immediately.  I usually like serving with rice, but add it to fettuccine and you can call the dish Lo Mein.

Go easy on the mirin until you get a feel for it, its tasty and adds a wonderful flavor, but its also some of the sweetest stuff you will ever cook with that isn't pure sugar.  Since, as a rule, you want your stir fry to be savory rather than sweet, you want to be careful that the mirin only adds some flavor and acts as a contrasting ""more"" element to the savory.

Fish sauce is, as I said, a mostly South Asian (Vietnam, Cambodia, etc) rather than East Asian ingredient, but I think it really adds nicely to the flavor.

As for vinegar, I like the cheap ""balsamic"" stuff.  It isn't really balsamic, of course, but it is real wine vinegar and that's nice, it adds some extra zap to the food, wakes up flavors, etc.

I typically use 8 oz or so of broth, and quite a lot (4 oz?) of soy sauce as my sauce base, the rest is ""to taste"", which means I really don't have a clue how much I use.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/9czei/im_a_foodie_on_a_muchneeded_diet_im_pretty_good/

By mimicking that through IF, your body cannot standardize its metabolism.  It helps keep you in ketosis which keeps you burning fat.  It also increases your energy (believe it or not).  IF doesn't have to be a full day if you don't want it to be, it can be just skipping a meal or switching around your meal timing.

For the past several months I’ve been having issues that make it hard to swallow food. As such, I’ve switched to a primarily liquid diet although certain softer foods are OK (Think pudding, yogurt, pastes etc.). While smoothies and other things are great, it’s a lot of sweet flavors, and I crave savory stuff, especially something that I can actually eat rather than drink (I have a disability that makes eating drippy things with a spoon hard, so while soups help me get some of the flavors I crave, they are a pain to eat). Do y’all have any suggestions? I feel like my google-fu is missing key terms, or this is just a not-at-all-strangely uninvestigated space.

More details and idiot-proofing the further down you read, so if you know what you're doing in the kitchen feel free to skim as you get further down.

&#x200B;

So what most people know as tzatziki sauce is actually supposed to be a... salad I guess you could call it. It's yogurt and cucmbers mixed together and spiced that you eat straight/with bread as a meal or as a significant portion of a meal (yes, yogurt is a meal, it has plenty of protein. Ditto cheese. I've had people mock my meals like this, but this is a common thing with Near-Eastern style food).

&#x200B;

The dish spans continents and has plenty of similar names. In my parents' Farsi it's jajeek, in Armenian it may be known as yalanchi, in Arabic it's jalajeek, to Greeks it's tzatziki. Even India has it but known as Raita but a bit more different than the other recipes. 

&#x200B;

I don't provide measurements because I don't think it's necessary here or for most of practical cooking. I trust the reader won't spastically add a solid handful of salt or 2 cups of oil to one tub of yogurt. Outside of that, everything is to taste. Only thing I'd say is 2 to 4 cloves of garlic for your typical 32 ounce tub of yogurt is already pretty garlicky... I believe, I haven't made this in a while. The garlic flavor will be stronger the next day as the yogurt absorbs the flavor of the garlic.

&#x200B;

So the tl;dr version for people who are very versed in cooking is that it's any kind of unflavored yogurt seasoned with garlic and dried mint or dried oregano and a bit of extra salt. Use only the dried herb. Crush/mince the garlic with the salt and let it sit for a bit to draw out and mellow the flavor; I've read some people soak the garlic in lemon juice to do this, but I can't vouch for that method. I feel like using mainly oregano as the herb could go well with a small pinch of mint, but if you're using mainly mint I wouldn't use oregano, I don't think those flavors mix well in large amounts. Other commonly included ingredients are olive oil, lemon juice, and white pepper. It will last a lot longer if you keep it as a yogurt mix and scoop out some and mix with cucumbers separately when you want to have the salad. Adding a little olive oil if you want it won't make the yogurt break/separate. Nor should lemon juice, even with 2% yogurt, as long as you don't add too much. Lemon might make it more grainy if you use 1.5% non-greek but it's not the end of the world (there's a note below if you don't know what I'm talking about).

&#x200B;

\-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

&#x200B;

To add a little more analysis for people who need it:

Feel free to use whatever kind of yogurt you like for nutritional purposes, but the most traditional and best flavor and texture for this use is just plain whole milk yogurt, non-greek style. Greek yogurt is fine if you want that extra protein, but it doesn't mix as well and doesn't carry the flavor as well and isn't as savory as regular yogurt (I think the comparatively extra water of regular yogurt helps carry the umami/salt flavor better). 2% yogurt is also OK to cut back calories, but obviously it won't taste as good. Using olive oil (NOT extra virgin, see below) if you're using 2% yogurt may be a good idea to replace some of the fat that would otherwise be there and bring in more flavor. Nutritionally this would be healthier according to some people's opinions because you'd be taking some of the butterfat you'd be having with whole milk and replacing it with olive oil fat, which is heart healthier. But remember, fat is fat and OVEDRdoing it has the same fattening and heart-health effects regardless of the kind of fat.

You shouldn't be using extra virgin olive oil for this because it's too strong and bitter. In general I find extra virgin olive oil isn't really suitable for most cooking for this same reason, only for bread dipping and maybe some salad dressings. 

You shouldn't be using fat-free yogurt for this because there isn't sufficient flavor. In fact, you shouldn't be using fat-free yogurt for anything you're going to eat because the tastiness/healthiness ratio is just way too low to justify it. 1.5% yogurt saves on enough calories while still tasting decent.

&#x200B;

The stuff below gets into idiot-proofing. Each paragraph is one topic, so if you know about the caveat within the first sentence, you can skip the paragraph:

&#x200B;

The mention above about the yogurt becoming grainy if you add lemon juice, if you do not understand, is that lemon juice curdles dairy products. Fats, starches, and proteins prevent this process from occuring, so a higher-fat yogurt will be less likely to curdle. If the yogurt does curdle a bit which may happen with 1.5%

&#x200B;

When I say crush/mince the garlic with salt, I mean that the resultant paste/particles should be mixed with salt. I usually just add a pinch into the garlic-crusher I use so the garlic comes out already mixed with salt. The salt will draw out the moisture from the garlic, which carries a lot of flavor, but will also help mellow it out by exposing it to the air (again, let it sit for a bit, however long is practical. Even 5 minutes will do. If you don't want to wait don't, just do this step first and let it sit for as long as it takes you to do everything else). If you don't have a garlic-crusher, I recommend investing in a good one, since adding garlic and lots of it is essential to good cooking and something you'll be doing often.

&#x200B;

And while I'm still adding stuff to make this recipe idiot-proof, let me mention that your cucumbers should be peeled and chopped medium to small. No exact size, just how you like it.

&#x200B;

Yogurt by itself lasts a damn long time in the fridge, like six weeks, and the added salt here may make it last longer.

&#x200B;

If you don't understand what I'm referring to when I keep mentioning 2% or 1.5% yogurt, it's referring to the fat content. They make low-fat yogurts by removing some of the fat, which cuts backs on calories and makes the yogurt healthier generally speaking. The yogurt that is not in any way low fat may be marked as ""whole milk"" yogurt. 2%, 1.5%, and 1% yogurts have less and less fat respectively. 0% yogurt may be marked as ""fat-free"" yogurt or ""skim-milk"" yogurt.

&#x200B;

White pepper is like black pepper, but without that outer black coating. It's the sharp bite of pepper, but none of the aroma, a much simpler, lighter flavor but still a lot of bite. You should buy it pre-ground in the spice aisle (which is usually in the baking aisle). One good thing about it is it never relly gets old, since it's all bite and no aroma, there's no aroma to slowly volatilize off and it will always have that bite.

&#x200B;

And of course, you can use it as a sauce for gyros. Obviously cut the cucumbers very small in that case.

&#x200B;

And one last ancillary note:

There are people who add soaked raisins and walnuts in there, but I really don't like it that way. This dish should be all savory no sweet, though the texture of the nuts some people may like (just soak raw dried walnuts in lightly salted water overnight. This is also a traditional Persian way of eating walnuts in general).

DOOGH / TAHN / AYRAN recipe - YOGURT DRINK recipe - functional explanation

&#x200B;

This is a yogurt-based drink that goes by a lot of different names in a lot of different countries, again all in the Near-East. You can even buy it pre-made and bottled at middle eastern shops, though it's not nearly as good as home made and it's an easy recipe. And yes, they bottle yogurt-based sodas, weird, I know. The white yogurt part eventually settles to the bottom and you have to mix it up a lot of the time right before you consume it.

&#x200B;

Basically you mix regular, unflavored, whole-milk yogurt into water with some salt, and stir it up to mix it. Usually you add some dried mint. It should be noticeably salty, but not crazy salty like let's say a V8. Enough to bring out a strong salty savory flavor. It should be fully liquid and pourable, obviously thicker than water, but still full-on beverage-level pourability. Can put ice in the glass to keep cold, is fine.

&#x200B;

You might be able to get away with 2% yogurt, but I wouldn't go any lower than that in fat content, you need them fat for flavor and already this is a drink that's thinned out with water. And don't use Greek yogurt as it's like stepping backward to step forward - Greek yogurt is just yogurt with a lot of the water removed, when in this recipe you're adding water anyway. Maybe in theory you could make more of the drink with one tub of Greek yogurt since it's more concentrated and you could just add more water? But I wouldn't try it, Greek yogurt tastes a bit different.",3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fstpw5/tzatziki_and_ayran_recipes_functional_version/

2020-03-10 18:56:58,submission,recipes,Smokey chorizo & steak chili,"As with pretty much any chili ""recipe"" this is mostly a guide, add, subtract, omit whatever you prefer. 

Also, this makes a lot of chili – be prepared for leftovers!


### INGREDIENTS
• 7-9 links raw, uncured chorizo sausage, casings removed

• 2 well-marbled boneless ribeye steaks, cubed (trim any excess fat to avoid tough, chewy bites)

• 1 medium-large red onion, roughly chopped

• ~4 tablespoons minced garlic

• 3 cans Mutti Polpa finely chopped tomatoes

• 1 can black beans, undrained

• ~2-3 tablespoons Better Than Bouillon beef stock concentrate

• 1 large bunch fresh cilantro, roughly chopped (set a few tablespoons aside for topping, if desired)

• 2-3 ears fresh corn

• 1 medium-large sweet potato, peel and cut in half, microwave until soft, cool, then cube

• 1 medium wedge smoked gouda, cubed

• 1 tall can light beer, like Sapporo

• Smoked paprika

• Cumin

• Chili powder

• Chipotle powder (if available use whole, dried peppers, toast them and pulverize in a food processor instead) 

• Red pepper flake (omit if using whole chipotle pepper, depending on taste/heat tolerance) 

• Cocoa powder

• Salt

• ½ ripe avocado per serving, cubed (topping)

• Plain Greek yogurt or restaurant-style sour cream (topping)*

• Spring/ green onion, finely chopped (topping)

• Corn tortilla chips (topping)


### DIRECTIONS
1.) Cube, lightly salt, and rest steak on paper towel for at least 10 minutes then blot with clean, dry paper towel to remove excess moisture from meat.

2.) Brown cubed steak on medium-high until outside of steak cubes are nicely seared but inside is still medium-rare. Remove meat from pot and set aside. Do not wash the pot!

3.) Reduce heat to medium-low, brown & crumble chorizo sausage in the beef fond until almost cooked through.
Add onion, cook until semi-translucent, add garlic, cook until fragrant.

4.) Meanwhile, cut kernels from corn cobs and slightly char in a hot cast iron skillet, remove from heat and set aside. 

4.) Add beans and canned tomatoes, bring to a simmer, add cooked sweet potato & charred corn.

5.) Add the various dry spices and adjust to taste, as base begins to thicken, add beer & beef stock until desired consistency and flavor have been achieved.

* For a creamier chili, add Greek yogurt at this stage. This will tone down the heat considerably so be sure to adjust accordingly!


6.) Re-incorporate beef, stir in cubed gouda until melted throughout, add fresh cilantro last.


7.) Serve and top with a dollop of Greek yogurt, avocado, green onion, reserved cilantro, and corn tortilla chips (Tostitos Hint of Spicy Queso chips work *great*).

8.) ENJOY! 😊",2,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fgix5b/smokey_chorizo_steak_chili/

2019-05-23 02:23:12,submission,recipes,Ray's Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies,"I shared a story and recipe two years ago which arose from a ""cookie exchange"" at work. 

[ Post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/5zfa4e/peanut_butter_vanilla_cookies/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share ] 


When a coworker said she was going to bring in Triple Chocolate Chip cookies, I swore I'd bring in quadruple vanilla cookies. It was my first time baking cookies, but they actually turned out good.

I took a triple chocolate chip cookie recipe and tweaked it to achieve my prior results. Then about a year ago, I swore I'd tweak the recipe and make chocolate chip cookies. 

One year later, I finally felt motivated enough to follow through. This is my second time baking cookies, but they actually turned out to be delicious in my opinion. My roommate seemed to enjoy his and I enjoyed quite a few. 

My technique and approach even improved greatly this time around, in my humble opinion. I think that will be reflected in the way the instructions are broken down this time around. It took me day the first time. This time I split the process into two days, deciding to chill the dough overnight instead of for a few hours. Things went by much quicker. It took me most of a a Sunday the last time, this time I did things after work and was done each day fairly early. 

They taste pretty good. No single flavor is overpowering. The recipe could probably use more chocolate chips, but I'll present it as is and leave it up to you to decide how you want to tweak it, should you decide to make these.

Here is the recipe:

NOTE: AGAIN THE RECIPE COULD PROBABLY BENEFIT IN A SLIGHT INCREASE OF CHOCOLATE CHIPS, MORSELS, AND PIECES. 

Ingredients 


- 1.5 sticks of butter (I used salted) 
- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- .5 cup of light brown sugar
- 2/3 cup of granulated sugar 
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp cream cheese 
- 1/4 cup of molasses
- 1 pk instant vanilla pudding mix 
- 1/2 cup of powdered chocolate peanut butter
- 1/4 cup of cocoa powder
- 6 oz melted white chocolate** (I used two types one specifically for baking and one that was either Lindt or Ghirardelli) 
- 1/2 cup melted butterscotch morsels
- 1/4 cup cookie butter
- Add 1/2 cup of vanilla or plain yogurt 
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda 
- Salt (I used a few pinches of sea salt 
- 1/3 cup of chocolate chips
- 1/3 cup of nestle chocolate morsels
- 4oz of milk chocolate broken into pieces (I used baker's chocolate and a regular Hershey Bar.) 

You'll also need:

- Parchment paper 
- Cling wrap 
- Wisk
- Cookie scoop***
- 2 baking sheets minimum 
- Large bowl 

Leave butter out for 15-20 mins so it warms to room temperature; cut into smaller squares to speed up process. 

**1. Mix the ingredients below well with a whisk until texture is creamy.**

- 1.5 sticks of butter 
- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- .5 cup of light brown sugar
- 2/3 cup of granulated sugar 
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp cream cheese 
- 1/4 cup of molasses


**2. Scrape down sides of bowl; add ingredients below; mix until just combined**

- 1 pk instant vanilla pudding mix 
- 1/2 cup of powdered chocolate peanut butter**
- 1/4 cup of cocoa powder
- 6 oz melted white chocolate**
- 1/2 cup melted butterscotch morsels**
- 1/4 cup cookie butter  

**To melt set the microwave to 50% power and run for 1 minute. You will need to run additionally, at 50% stirring every 30 seconds until it is mostly melted. This took me an additional minute for both the white chocolate and butterscotch morsels.
(I melted my ingredients in microwave safe glass bowls, which may affect heating time.)

**3. Scrape down sides of bowl; add ingredients below; mix until just combined**

- Add 1/2 cup of vanilla or plain yogurt 

**4. Scrape down sides of bowl; add ingredients below; mix until just combined**

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda 
- salt to taste 

**5. Scrape down sides of bowl; add ingredients below; mix until just combined**

- 1/3 cup of chocolate chips
- 1/3 cup of nestle chocolate morsels
- 4oz of milk chocolate broken into pieces 

**6. Cover bowl with cling wrap and chill dough in refrigerator over night**

Baking instructions: 



1. Preheat oven to 350 °F


2. Cover your baking sheets with oven safe parchment paper. 


3. Use a medium cookie scoop and place about 12 mounds (or whatever seems reasonable) on a single baking tray. Make sure they are spaced out. 


4. Bake for about 15 minutes. ( I baked a single tray at a time. So I did this about 5 times. As the dough was sitting out for a little while, and warming up,  I lowered my cook time after the second batch. By the 3rd it was 14 minutes, 4th 13 minutes, and 5th was 12 minutes)


5. Cookies will firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 15 minutes.


6. Enjoy and share with the people you love

Budget advice: This is one that I usually follow when it comes to chicken, since meat is typically the most expensive item on my shopping list. If you notice that the breast is larger than normal, you can slice them in half to get 2 filets.

Some seasonings and condiments aren’t listed, as most people have the basics on hand. And remember, let’s make the most of your budget by buying what is on a deal at your grocery store and substitute! For example, chicken thighs are usually noticeably cheaper than breasts.

**Breakfast (all 7 days)**

*Overnight Oats*

For 7 meals: 1L milk, 3.5 cups dry oats, 1.75 cups frozen fruit

I recommend making this each night before you eat them the following morning, but you can also store these for up to 3 days if you want to make a small batch.

For 1 meal - In a jar or bowl, combine 140 mL milk and 1/2 cup dry oats.

Simply stir it all up and store it in the fridge overnight. In the morning, add 1/4 cup frozen fruit of your choice, and it’s ready to eat!

**Lunch (days 1-3)**

*Egg Salad Sandwich*

For 3 meals: 5 hard-boiled eggs, 1 celery stalk, 1 tbsp mustard, 1 tbsp dill, 1/4 cup (2oz) Greek yogurt, 6 slices of bread, 3 Russet potatoes

Combine diced eggs, diced celery, mustard, dill, and Greek yogurt in a large bowl. Mix together and add salt and black pepper to taste. Split into 3 portions and serve between 2 slices of toasted bread for lunch. Or, if you want to aim for less carbs, trade the bread for some leafy greens.

As a side for this sandwich, go ahead and cut 3 potatoes in either wedge shape or thick fries. Bake in the oven at 400F. Every 10 minutes, flip and toss them around. Continue this until the outside is crispy. Add any seasonings after it’s finished cooking. Divvy this up into 3 portions.

**Lunch (days 4-7)**

*Chicken Salad Sandwich*

For 3 meals: 2 chicken breasts, 9 celery stalks, 1/2 small red onion, 1 tbsp dill, 1/4 cup (2oz) Greek yogurt, 12 tbsp nut butter, 8 slices of bread

Cook and shred the chicken breasts, and of course, season to your liking. In a large bowl, combine the shredded chicken, 1 diced celery stalk, 1/2 diced red onion, 1 tbsp dill, and 1/4 cup Greek yogurt. Split this into 4 portions and serve between 2 slices of toasted bread for lunch. Or, if you want to aim for less carbs, trade the bread for some leafy greens.

As a side for this sandwich, we’ll use the remaining stalks of celery. Cut them in fourths and serve with 3 tbsp of nut butter for each meal.

**Dinner (days 1 and 2)**

*Falafel Bowl*

For 2 meals: 2 cups parsley, 2 tomatoes, 1 lemon, 6 falafels, 1/2 cucumber, 1 cup cooked quinoa (1/2 cup uncooked), 2oz (4 tbsp) hummus, 1 pita bread

I suggest halving the recipe and making this fresh each night.

In a bowl, simply add all the ingredients (chop them to your preference first), except the pita bread and lemon.

For the pita bread, cut it into small triangles. Serve it all together with 1/2 a lemon squeezed over as dressing.

**Dinner (day 3 and 4)**

*Mediterranean Spinach and Lentil Soup*

What you’ll need: 1 yellow onion, 1 garlic clove, 1 tbsp ground coriander, 1 tbsp ground cumin, 6 cups vegetable broth, 1.5 cups spinach, 2 cups lentils, 1 tbsp flour, 4 cups water, 1 lemon, 2 cups parsley

In a large pot, add 2 tbsp of oil. Add chopped onions and cook until golden brown. Add chopped garlic, a tbsp of flour, and all the spices. Cook this for about 2 minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly.

Next, add the vegetable broth and water and bring it all to a boil. Add the spinach and lentils, cook for about 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook this for about 20 minutes. Half way through cooking, check the liquid levels, you may need more water as the lentils may soak it up quickly. The final dish will be very thick, but it shouldn’t be dry.

Once the lentils are fully cooked, stir in the juice from 1 lemon and add chopped parsley. Remove from the heat and let this sit for about 5 minutes. Divvy this up for 2 dinners and save the rest for snacks later in the week.

**Dinner (days 5-7)**

*Open-Face Chicken Gyros*

For 3 meals: 3 chicken breasts, 1 tomato, 3 pita breads, 1/2 cucumber, 1/2 red onion, 1/4 cup (2oz) Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp dill, 1/2 lemon, 3 Russet potatoes

First, prepare your tzatziki sauce. I recommend do this the night before, as it only gets better with time. In a bowl, mix 1/4 Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp dill, juice from 1/2 lemon, and 1/4 of a cucumber that’s been finely diced.

Next, get started with baking cubed potatoes in the oven at 400F. Every 10 minutes, flip and toss them around. Continue this until the outside is crispy. While the potatoes are baking, add diced chicken to a pan and cook over medium-high heat. Bonus points if you have a grill pan. Feel free to season this as you wish - garlic salt and black pepper are suggested.

On a plate, add the pita bread, cooked chicken, cucumber slices, tomatoes slices, red onion slices, and drizzle tzatziki sauce over top. Serve with potatoes.

**Snacks**

*Falafel and Hummus*

For 3 days: 6 falafels, 3oz (6 tbsp of hummus)

Eat 2 falafels with 2 tbsp of hummus. If you bought lemons in bulk, feel free to squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top.

*Mediterranean Spinach and Lentil Soup*

For 4 days: Enjoy the leftovers from your lentil soup that you had prepared on day 3.

Here's the list of some starter recipes which you can make on saturday or sunday easily.

SALAD JAR: 
this can be a classic meal prep lunch. They are not only quick and easily made but you can make variety of these with just some greens and pasta. Simply put some vegetables between the greens and the pasta and it’s done. Sprinkle dressing on top of the ingredients and close up the lid! You can even add chicken if you wanna convert it into a non-vegetarian salad. No mess, no fuss. You will simply shake the jar to mix it all together and evenly spread the dressing before eating. I have a few yummy Mason Jar recipes in my Eat.Reinvented nutrition plan!! Here is a teaser for ya!

BUDDHA BOWL:
these bowls usually include some kind of grain or blend of grains, some   vegetables can be beans or tofu. The thing I like about these bowls is that they can be made ahead and freeze. And once you start preparing such bowls you’ll get into the habit of preparing your own grain bowls by putting into it whatever you feel like...it’s more of like use- everything meal.

Planning and preparing your meals ahead of time will make healthy choices no-brainer. Instead of running for a cold cut calorie bomb you’ll have a home cooked feast on hand that can be heated up quite fast.

​​
 
Riddle me this: What do ranch dressing, a plumber's crack, and the Alaskan Bush have in common?

Answer: Everything. Hidden Valley Ranch dressing was developed by Steve Henson in 1949 while working as a plumber and cook in the Alaskan Bush in 1949. He was working out a three year contract as a plumber but ended up cooking for the crew. Henson knew he was cooking for a tough crowd. He reported that if the men did not like a dish they were just as likely to throw it at the cook as they were to walk out cursing.  The men were especially disgruntled when served salad... AGAIN!

Henson began experimenting with 3 basic ingredients  and a salad dressing was born. He had buttermilk, mayonnaise, and an assortments of herbs in one hand and a need to pacify cranky plumbers in the other.  His fellow plumbers liked his creamy white stuff and agreed to eat their veggies peacefully; no more plates were thrown at Henson. A few profane words might have been uttered from time to time but the plates and Henson's head were finally safe.

Henson left the Alaskan Bush in 1952 to pursue his dream of owning and operating a dude ranch hideaway for tourists. He took his recipe with him to serve guests at the ranch. Dude ranch tourists loved it and wanted to buy bottles of his dressing. Demand outstripped his ability to supply bottles of Ranch Dressing so he began selling spice packets that could be mixed with buttermilk and mayonnaise at home. Recipe booklets flooded the market and ranch dressing was no longer used only as means of calming volatile plumber tempers. It had gone mainstream.

This chicken salad is a cool alternative to a hot heavy meal in the August heat.If you purchase a roasted chicken at your local grocery store the dinner can be ready to eat in 30 minutes without heating up the kitchen. I think it tastes even better the next day so I often make this salad one evening, stash it in the refrigerator, and eat it the next. It is refreshingly cool and creamy with a mild ranch flavor.

I made a few changes to the 1962 recipe. First, I buy my chicken roasted instead of cooking it myself. I also substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise. I like the tang and added body of sour cream. The original recipe calls for plain yogurt; I use plain Greek yogurt.

​​
 
Chicken Ranch Salad
½ cup sliced almonds, toasted
2 cups cooked and cooled chicken, cubed
1 cup celery, diced
1 can (8 oz.) pineapple chunks, drained
1 can (8 oz.) sliced water chestnuts, drained
1½  cups seedless grapes, halved

Dressing
1 package (1 oz.) dry Ranch Salad Dressing Mix
½ cup sour cream (or mayonnaise per the original recipe)
½ cup plain yogurt (I prefer Greek)
¼ cup honey

To toast almonds place them in a single layer in a frying pan. Place over medium heat. Stir often and watch carefully because nuts go from perfectly toasted and aromatic to burned in very short order.

Let pineapple and chestnuts drain through a strainer placed over a bowl. While pineapple and chestnuts are draining cube chicken, dice celery, and halve grapes. Place all in a large salad bowl.

To make dressing empty Ranch Salad Dressing Mix into medium sized bowl. Add yogurt, sour cream (or mayonnaise), and honey. Mix well.  Pour over chicken mixture and very gently stir.

Sprinkle toasted almonds over the top.
Eat right away or cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.",12,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/6s5cfn/ranch_chicken_salad/

2017-05-30 17:57:37,submission,recipes,Indian spiced egg and spinach naan wrap (Gordon Ramsay),"**Note:** This recipe was originally removed due to lack of flair. Further note, dear mods, if there's any way to get around that on mobile I would sincerely appreciate it. Really frustrating to have typed out a whole recipe on my phone and then have it taken down immediately because I am unable to flair the post.

Recipe taken from this video. Made this for the first time today and it was absolutely fantastic. The portions I used made 3 good sized wraps.

Ingredients:

- 4 eggs (whisked)

- 3 naan wraps (frozen)

- 1 tsp garam masala

- 2 tsp tumeric (divided)

- 1 tsp mustard seeds

- 1 tsp cumin

- 1/2 large or 1 medium white onion cut into strips

- roughly 4 cups unpacked spinach

- natural plain yogurt (I used a 5oz container from the store

- fresh mint leaves (about 3 sprigs worth)

- olive oil

- butter

Recipe:

1. Heat 1 tbs of oil over medium heat in a frying pan. Add in 1 tsp of cumin and mustard seeds. If you have all ingredients prepped this is a good time to preheat another frying pan on medium low heat.

2. Once the spices are fragrant add onions. Sauté until they begin to caremalize. Stir continuously to get full flavor of spices absorbed. Add 1/2 tbs of butter after you have initially stirred in the onions to incorporate the spices.

3. When onions are loose and have gotten a bit of color, add the spinach and cook until wilted. Remove this mix to a cutting board.

4. Add another tbs of oil to the same pan. When heated add 1 tsp of garam masala and tumeric each. Stir until well incorporated into the oil. In the other pan, put your naan in and begin to toast. As we move forward, you'll want to periodically check on these and make sure they don't burn. Toast both sides of each naan and then remove to a plate. Additionally, give the spinach/onion mix a good rough chop so that consistency is good in the final dish.

5. Add the eggs to your main skillet with your spices. Continually scramble the eggs. Add 1-2 tbs of butter as they cook and stir it through. Roughly halfway through cooking the eggs, add in spinach egg mix and fold into the eggs. Remove pan from heat when eggs are finished.

6. In a separate bowl, mix mint and yogurt together.

7. On a plate, fill half a naan with the egg mix and top with yogurt mix. Fold the other half over and voila, deliciousness.

This recipe is very simple but works very quickly so prepping before hand is highly advises. That said, it's totally awesome and I'll be having it again.",128,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/6e8zqr/indian_spiced_egg_and_spinach_naan_wrap_gordon/

2017-03-14 22:02:32,submission,recipes,Peanut Butter Vanilla Cookies,"These cookies actually started out as a complete joke. I had never baked cookies (or really anything) before, but I have two coworkers who are great at baking and quite passionate about it. Jokingly, another coworker and I proposed that we ALL bring in cookies and have an exchange. I didn't expect them to seriously consider doing so with such short notice, but by the end of the day I realized they were likely going to bring some in the following week. One of the women said she'd bring in triple chocolate cookies. I challenged her by saying I'd bring in quadruple vanilla cookies. They never take me seriously, because I joke around all the time so I thought it'd be hilarious if I actually did come up with a recipe and made the cookies. I looked up a quadruple chocolate chip cookie recipe and tweaked it heavily. I got very experimental with the ingredients, but ultimately after a ton of research and effort they came out quite well especially for a first attempt at baking. 
The recipe is a little busy, I know, but once my creative juices got flowing I just went with it. 
Wasn't crazy about them without the frosting at first and wasn't sure what to make of the flavor in the beginning even with the frosting (though it was pretty good; I just became very critical of myself even though it was a joke). They actually did grow on me significantly the closer I got to finishing them. 
They taste pretty decent. I think it's mainly just hard to set expectations for the taste because they don't have a dominant flavor and it's hard to categorize what you are tasting aside from the peanut butter chips. I got positive responses from my coworkers and manager who tried, including the two women, whose baking skills I respect. 
One thing I can promise is that they come out very soft if you follow the directions. 
Thought I'd share. If you're adventurous enough to dare to try it, let me know how it came out.

**Ingredients:**

- 1.5 sticks of unsalted butter 
- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup of light brown sugar
- 1/4 cup of granulated sugar 
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp cream cheese 
- 1 tbsp of maple syrup
- 1/4 cup molasses 
- 1 pk instant vanilla pudding mix 
- 1/4 cup Powdered peanut butter
- 4 oz melted white chocolate
- 1/2 cup of yogurt 
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda 
- Salt
- Pumpkin spice 
- 1 cup peanut butter chips
- Vanilla marshmallow frosting 

__________________

**Prep & Cooking Directions:**

Leave butter out for 15-20 mins so it warms to room temperature; cut into smaller squares to speed up process. 




1.5 sticks of unsalted butter, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, 2 large eggs, 2 tsp cream cheese, 1 Tbsp of maple syrup, 1/4 cup molasses   

**1. Mix the above ingredients well with a whisk until texture is creamy.** 




1 pk instant vanilla pudding mix, 1/4 cup Powdered peanut butter, 4oz melted white chocolate

**2. Scrape down sides of bowl; mix in the above until just combined**




1/2 cup of yogurt 

**3. Scrape down sides of bowl; mix in the above until just combined**




2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, salt to taste, pumpkin spice to taste (be conservative about how much you use) 

**4. Scrape down sides of bowl; mix in the above until just combined**




1 cup peanut butter chips

**5. Scrape down sides of bowl; mix in the above until just combined**



Use 1/4-cup and your hands to measure & form approximately 17 equal-sized mounds of dough. Roll into balls, and slightly flatten. Don't forget to flour the measuring cup and your hands. The dough can be quite sticky. Also, consider chilling the dough in the bowl for an hour and a half to help with this process. 

Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for 3 hours. Subtract any time you took to chill the dough previously before shaping. 

Preheat oven to 350F and lightly grease the baking sheet. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart and bake for about 15 minutes (I put 2 cookie sheets in at once and rotated 7.5 minutes in). The cookies will firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 to 15 minutes. 





Vanilla marshmallow frosting 

**6. Apply frosting to center of each cookie once the cookies cool; add sprinkles for decoration.**

2017-03-15 11:07:59,comment,recipes,,"It's not out of the blue. As stated in the opening story it's a heavily tweaked version of a quadruple chocolate chip cookie recipe. I had a basis for what I was doing. I just had to fill in knowledge gaps, get a little creative, and stay vigilant for all the common concerns/issues that come up when baking cookies. Comments other bakers made under the recipe and on other pages used for research were great prompts to help guide me in the right direction. 

I thought up my 4 vanillas in the grocery store (pre most of my research), with 2 of the ingredients (the extract and pudding mix) falling in line with the original recipe enough that it required little thought. 

I thought of yogurt out of desperation after being so close and needing a 4th vanilla to stay true to the joke. I looked up a yogurt chocolate chip cookie recipe later to get a sense of how much of that to add and just kind of played it safe with stuff that wasn't in either which was the pumpkin spice, molasses, cream cheese, maple syrup and powdered peanut butter.  

It's the output of a lot of research and careful thought from someone who's pretty decent at figuring out how to do things outside his comfort zone. 

If there are any gifts I possess they're resourcefulness, creativity, and an ability to self teach. 
I was and am passionate about music and taught myself how to compose on a sheet music program using bits and pieces of what I was taught and learned myself over the years (even managing to impress a few composers more learned than I that I'd encounter in the future) as well as recognize pitches in a fairly interesting way that kind of surprised my teacher who'd known me for years. This isn't my first go around teaching myself a new trick and not completely failing.

2017-03-15 12:38:17,comment,recipes,,"Thanks. Yeah I know the recipe is a bit busy. I had trouble nailing down the flavor of the plain cookie, as I explained in my story, so it was hard to name it. 
I basically named it for this post specifically. I chose what I did because with the peanut butter chips and powder, peanut butter was the thing that the two women and my manager identified first and since there's so much vanilla in the recipe I figured it had to be included in the name. Especially because it has vanilla frosting on top which is fairly easy to taste. 

I was pretty light on the pumpkin spice and maple syrup so they don't particularly stand out. I think the molasses is there a little, but I don't think it's noticeable in and of itself either amongst the other ingredients. For what's immediately noticeable, I'd say the name is fine, but it could be better I suppose.

I just took the route of priming readers minds for the obvious. The other stuff will just be the ""secret ingredients"" that make the recipe somewhat special. Hahaha.   ",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/5zfa4e/peanut_butter_vanilla_cookies/

2016-12-22 03:00:21,submission,recipes,"So, I gradually build up a collection of my favorite recipes for living as a poor student. Now I have reached the character limit I may as well give them to you all. These are my go-to dinners for most of the year","**Heres all the recipes that have kept me alive as a student for minimal cost and maximum happiness.**

Most of these make more portions than 1, but scale everything appropriately. Soup makes about 3, curry and chicken is for 1-2, and paella is for 2-3

**Chinese chicken soup** :

bring pan to boil, then add 1 teaspoon of chinese 5 spice, and 1 chicken stock cube. Dissolve the spices.

add 1 chicken breast, then simmer on low for 25 minutes
remove chicken onto plate, then shred with forks

add chicken back into pan, then add frozen peas, spinach, green (spring) onions, and mushrooms.

add soy sauce to taste.

**Curry** :

dice (ie chop into very small bits) an onion

get frying pan with some oil, then gently fry onions for 5-10 minutes until the whiteness is turned into translucence

dice (make into cubes about the size of a dice) 1 chicken breast, and add to frying pan

add 1-2 tablespoon of ready-mixed curry powder. If you want to do this yourself the spice mix I use is 1 tsp of each - cumin, turmeric, fennel, coriander, chilli powder, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a large pinch of salt

once chicken is browned and maybe cooked through, add 1 tin of chopped tomatoes, then simmer for at least 20 minutes. adding lime is good.

If you can't be fucked cooking rice you can add 1 diced sweet potato and cook for at least 35 minutes.

taste, if it is bland add more spices, if it is unspicy add more chilli powder, if it needs more salt add some. You can go pretty wild with the vegetables in this, adding things like celery or mushrooms at the same time as the onions, or peas at the end, is all extra flavor and nutrition. If you want it to be more creamy, add some icelandic yogurt or just normal natural yogurt

**Lazy paella**:

put 1-3 chicken thigh in oven, cover with oil, then cook at 180 degrees c for 35 mins. take out, cool, then pull the meat off

boil water in pan, add tumeric, add rice.

when rice has 2 minutes left add frozen peas and frozen fish or shrimp, fish can be crazy cheap. Smoked sausage is also an easy 2 minute ingredient that makes this better.

add chicken thigh, and salt and pepper to taste


**Carbonara-ish**

I make a carbonara using eggs, milk, with a tiny bit of chorizo with rosmary and a kick of chili, and it is amazing, and the eggs replace the cheesyness I crave. I base it off [this recipe](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pasta-recipes/chorizo-carbonara-with-catalan-market-salad/) but half the chorizo, very little cheese if any, and no salad

**sweet potato wedges**


sweet potato wedges are a very low calorie replacement that hits the same spot as fries. Just wedge em, spray with some of that 1 calorie spray, add herbs/spices depending on what flavour you're going for.

**Broccoli and cauliflower soup**, possibly the lowest calorie thing I make super regularly, and it is super tasty. 

Fry 1 small onion in about 1/2 a teaspoon of oil, low and slow, this adds great sweetness. Add 2 head of broccoli and 1 head of cauliflower, then 1 chicken stock cube and enough water to fill up the pan. Add a big amount of pepper (bit by bit then taste) while boiling. cook for about 10 mins then blend. 

roughly 100 kcal

**chicken chilli wrap.** 

Poach in barely simmering water a chicken breast in water with a bit of salt and chili for about 25 mins, remove and shred. reduce water down to not much, then add chicken in again with 1/8 can cannolini beans, chopped tomatos, chopped fresh chili, tonnes of mushrooms, then reduce down again till not much water left. Without a wrap it sits at about 220 kcal

**Japenese Udon Noodles** - 

Poach 1 chicken breast in water, with 1 heaped tsp of chinese 5 spice and 2tbs of soy sauce. Cook for 20 mins then remove and shred. add 1 clove of garlic, chicken stock cube, tonnes of mushrooms, and some [udon noodles](http://img.21food.com/20110609/product/1305081968546.jpg). Finish with 1 tbsp of Worcester sauce and some spring onions (scallions). sits at 475 calories, but normally does 2 big bowls.

**tuna mayo pasta**

Probably the simplest meal you can make.

Boil 250g pasta for 10 mins, (this makes 2 huge servings)

When pasta has 2 minutes left, stir in some frozen peas and sweetcorn

Open a can of cheap tuna and drain the oil/brine/water

Drain pasta, then stir in tuna, a little olive oil, and a good amount of mayonnaise

Add a good amount of pepper, a wee bit of salt, some (dried) basil, and some garlic powder. Some chili flakes are never a bad move either.

**Pork Wellington**

This one is for showing off, as it looks amazing, but it is also suprisingly easy and, when you get pork tenderloin on the cheap, can actually be reasonably cheap.

Fry a finely diced onion and some finely diced mushrooms. 

Roll out about half a block of frozen pastry so it is about 20cm up and as wide as your tenderloin is long

place bacon on the pastry, covering as much of the surface as you can afford

once mushrooms and onions have softened, spread over bacon/pastry

place tenderloin on top, then roll up into a cylinder and seal the ends.

Cook in the oven for about 40 minutes at around 170C

serve with lots of brocolli/other greens

makes about 4 portions

**Carrot and coriander (cilantro?) soup**

Slice up 2 onions, and gently fry in some butter in a deep pan.

Peel and chop up like 10 carrots, then once the onions are cooked fire them in

add loads of vegetable stock

cook for 20 minutes or until the carrots are soft, then blend with a stick blender

Finely slice a whole bunch of corriander, and add in. Add in a tablespoon more butter and S&P


**sausage pasta**

chop a couple sausages into bite-size chunks, then put into a lightly oiled baking dish. Add a bunch of quartered mushrooms, then add salt and pepper, and shove in the oven. They need about 15 minutes at around 180C (fan) or 200C

Boil about 300g pasta for 10 minutes in salted water. After 5 minutes add a shit-tonne of broccoli

Once pasta is done, drain, add frozen peas and sweetcorn, and let that defrost for 30 seconds or so. 

stir in passata (crushed tomatoes), enough to make it look saucy, then some Worcester sauce (only a wee bit), lots of basil, lots of garlic powder, and salt and pepper. 

Get the sausage/mushrooms out the oven when they are cooked, then pour the pasta into the baking dish and stir round. top with cheese and but back in for about 15 minutes

Makes about 5 servings


**pasta pesto**

This one often isn't cheap, as fucking pine nuts cost crazy money recently. 

Boil pasta for 10 mins, adding frozen sweetcorn at the 8 minute mark.

In a blender, add about two plants of basil, 50g of pine nuts, some oil, and a garlic clove or three, and blend into a paste.

add to pasta

**Gumbo-ish**

Get 7 boneless chicken thighs (or 3-4 breasts), cover in oil and cajun spice mix, and put in the oven at 180 C for 35 minutes in a large cast iron skillet

Chop up 4 stalks of celery, 1/2 an onion, a good amount of mushrooms, 1-2 red bell pepper, a pack of okra a few cloves of garlic, and a good bit of chorizo (with the skin removed) 

Get a deep pot, and put in a good few tablespoons of butter, then melt, then add an equal number of heaped tablespoons of flour, and fry the roux very gently so it it begins to colour

When the chicken thighs are done, take them out the skillet and rest on a plate, then put the skillet on the hob and gently fry  all the vegetables and chorizo (I normally start with the onion and celery, then add chorizo for a couple minutes, then add everything else,

Chop up the chicken into bite size pieces.

once the veg is done, gradually add a couple liters of water and a chicken stock cube to the roux, and stir until there are no lumps. Add the veg into the pan and the chicken, and make sure the water level fills most the pan. Add a shit-tonne more cajun spice mix, salt, pepper, and some chili powder, and keep tasting and adding what it feels like it needs until it tastes how you want

Add a couple handfuls of white rice

Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, as the rice will stick to the bottom

**mushroom pasta**

get pasta boiling

Finely dice loads of mushroom

fry mushroom in a tiny bit of olive oil, and add a bit of salt

once they have cooked through, and when pasta has about 2 minutes left, add in a smallish nob of butter

stir through 1 very heaped tablespoon of flour

once everything is combined, add milk bit by bit until a thick creamy sauce is formed. Chuck some sweetcorn into the pasta pot

add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some basil (dried works well, but very finely sliced fresh would be awesome)

combine with pasta and serve.

**marsetti**

get about 500g of pasta boiling in salted water

finely dice an onion, and get it frying

once onion is translucent, add in 500g of mince

cook through

once everything is cooked, mix the frying pan with the pasta, then stir in 1 can of condensed mushroom soup and 1 can of condensed tomato soup, then add salt, pepper, garlic, and MSG.

move to an oven dish and cover with cheese mixed with breadcrumbs, then bake until everything is golden and crispy

**Lazy mushroom risotto**

Chop up 3-4 mushrooms and 1/2 a small onion per person finely diced. 

In a saucepan, fry onions in olive oil for about 5 minutes

add all the mushrooms and cook for a couple minutes, until they are browned and soft.

Add some butter then add 75-100g of risotto rice per person. 

cook rice in the butter for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly, then add 1/3 of a chicken stock cube per person

add a good covering of water. You are about to cook it for 20 minutes so don't put too little in

cover and cook on low for 10 minutes, stir, then cook for another 10 minute

If there is still too much water left cook uncovered for a few minutes whilst stirring. 

Add in s,p, garlic powder, a good bit of basil, some msg, and taste. Fix if it is missing anything

**EDIT** **sushi** REMOVED. I just found out I was risking poisoning people with my recipe. Sorry everyone. Here's a nice replacement of a recipe I made yesterday to make up for almost killing people

**Thai Vegetable Curry**

Put rice on

Dice an onion and some celery, and finely slice a carrot. Get a deep pan and cook gently in coconut oil

Cube up an aborigine, a courgette(Zucchini) a shit-tonne of mushrooms, and some broccoli florets, then add to the pan. Stir in some Thai Curry Paste and coconut milk, then simmer for 15 minutes

Finely slice half a bunch of coriander and 1/2 a lemon, and some spring onions. Fire them in, then taste to see if it needs anything. If it is a bit too thin, mix some cornflour with cold water and add in gently stirring the pan until it thickens

2025-05-18 16:29:39,comment,recipes,,"**prawn gochujang pasta**

This was an accident when trying to replicate some prawn and mozzerella croquettes I had in a restaurant, then tried to give them a Korean twist that ended up being good. The croquettes were a failed attempt, will try again next year, but I think this turned out good. All measurements in this are a guess as I made a massive batch so I'm estimating how much would be in a portion for 2-3 people. 

If unable to get raw prawns skip 1-3

Get about 500ml of milk in a pan on a hob. Swirl and stir it regularly so it doesn't burn, but all mine burned and stuck and it didn't affect the flavour but it did make washing up a pain. bring to a bare simmer.

add in about 70g of raw prawns and a bay leaf. preferably head on and everything and cook for about 2 mins then strain the milk INTO A CONTAINER then cool the milk again. 

If head on get out the prawn meat

Chop all the prwans into about 6mm dice

Get about 300g for 3 people pasta boiling

start a roux with about 50g butter and the same size amount of flour and cook for a few mins, then gradually add in milk until it is the saucy consistency you want. add in about 1/4 a teaspoon of gochujang and 1/3 a pack of dried dashi, or maybe about 1/4 a teaspoon. These are estimates so taste and add and taste. 

dice into a siimilar size as the prawns about 1/2 a ball of fresh mozzerella, not dry mozz. 

Slice a couple spring onions/scallions, reserving greens, and add the whites into the sauce

once pasta is done pop a ladle of the pasta water into the sauce if it needs it, then add in the sauce and prawns. Cook for a bit so everything gets to know each other and the sauce reaches peak consistency. 

add in the mozz and keep stirring till it just starts to melt but not fully, then serve immediately. Top with spring onion greens and serve.

**Chicken kimchi wrap**

Get chicken breast and slice horizontally into 7mm slices, add into pan with oil and fry, turning occasionally till cooked through. 

Get a wrap, smear with good quality mayonnaisse - I recommend polish Winiary - and pile on the chicken. Top with lots of kimchi, then wrap up and eat. Eat over a plate, it will leak. 


**chow mein**

Super easy, better than restaurants. 

for 2
Thinly slice about 3 boneless chicken thighs

Get a wok piping hot, add in the oil and swirl. Add in the thighs and let them brown and cook till done. probably about 3 mins, then take out and keep in a bowl. 

Finely slice a few spring onions, several mushrooms and maybe a pepper. 

Wok still on, oil again then fire in the mushrooms and pepper. cook till done, then add in some egg noodles, stir fry for 2-3 mins on as hot as it goes, then add in the chicken and spring onioin whites. 

add in 1.5tbsp light soy sauce, 1tbsp dark soy sauce, 1tbsp shaoxing wine, 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/4 teaspoon msg. mix thoroughly, taste and adjust then add in spring onion greens and serve.

**Gochujang noodles**

In a pan finely slice a chicken thigh per person, and 1/2 an onion along the grain, to get 1/2 circles. finely slice a spring onion

Get some dried thick rice noodles and follow package instructions, usually let em sit in boiling water for about 4 mins. 

In a wok fire chicken in when it's hot, and stir fry til the chicken is cooked. Add in about 1 tsp of gochujang, several shakes of gochugaru, and add just enough water to make saucy then add in a 1/2 pack or maybe 1/4 tbsp of dashi powder. add the noodles in and the spring onion. Give it a minute to reduce to the right consistency then serve.

**Tasty late night tofu**

Get a non stick wok going and some rice on

Get some good silken tofu, and dice into maybe 3cm cubes, then grab some paper towels and dry as much as possible. Add in the tofu to a heavily oiled wok and let it crisp a bit, It loves to stick so accept now that some crisp will be lost. 

Add in about 2 tbsp of peanut butter, 2tbsp of soy sauce, and maybe a teaspoon of dark chinese vinegar. add in some water and gently stir until it becomes a sauce. add in 1/4 tsp of msg and taste, then if it's good serve over rice.

**somewhat Thai Szechuan basil pork**

Get a big pan on and some oil in, and vertically slice an onion and add in. Once it’s started to soften add in 500g  minced pork, but beef works well too, as would most minced meat. Slice some mushrooms too and fire them in

While that’s cooking slice up 5 big garlic cloves, maybe 15 Birds Eye chilli’s, the whites of a handful of spring onions 

Take the cooked meat and things out, add in some fresh oil, and let the aromatics cook for a minute or two. While that’s going get the blender out and put in about a handful of Szechuan peppercorns. Blend these for ages, and they won't all blend in the end. Can also bash them in a pestle and mortar but it's a waste of time. 

Once everything’s had a minute add about 2tbps dark soy sauce, 2 tbsp oyster sauce, maybe 50ml of water, a tbsp of fish sauce, half a teaspoon of sesame oil, and maybe 2 tbsp of Chinese cooking wine. Add all the cooked meat and veg, and season with a lot of pepper, a pinch of msg, a couple pinches of sugarand taste and see if it is great. 

Let everything come back up to temp, and chop up two 50g or so packs of basil leaves, not sure how big the packs are, but should be about two handfuls of leaves before chopping. Once it’s bubbling reduce a touch so it’s a thick saucy consistency, then add in the basil leaves and **sift the blended Szechuan peppercorns, they’re a nightmare if not sifted.**

Serve over rice, or ramen noodles. If doing over ramen I often add in a tbsp of peanut butter to make it stickier and thicker and tastier

**beef shortrib pie**

For 4-6 servings

Preheat oven to about 150c

get about 1.2kg of beef shortrib, and start in a dutch oven in about 2tbsp oil by browning each chunk on all sides, about 6 mins on high heat

Meanwhile chop about 300g mushrooms and 2 onions into thick slices.

Once beef is browned, remove and brown the mushrooms and onions, cooking about 5 mins. While that's going slice a couple cloves of garlic, and once about 5 mins are past pop the sliced garlic in and cook stirring a good amount for a minute, then remove everything, and chill and then fridge the mushroom mix. 

While veg are cooking, in a blender, add in a couple tsp tomato paste, 2 beef or chicken stock cubes, 4 anchovy fillets, 2tsp of dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp of marmite, a few glugs of worchestershire sauce, 500ml hot but not boiling water, and grind in a bunch of pepper. Blend. 

back on the hob, add in a touch of oil if it's running low, then add back in the shortrib and any juice that ran out, and add 2 carrots cut in half, 2 onions chopped in half, 6 garlic cloves whole, and then 2 tbsp flour. Stir in and stir to coat, and then pop in a glass of wine and scrape up everything that is on the bottom of the pan. Once that has reduced back down fire in the blender water, and top up with water so it almost covers everything. Add in 4 sprigs of thyme and rosmary and a few bay leaves, then bring to the boil. pop into the oven. 

Cook in oven for 2 hours or so, then take out and remove the onion, garlic, herbs and carrot. Add back in the chilled onions and mushrooms and bring back to the boil, then back in the oven. 

Cook for 1-2 hours, tasting after 1 hour, wating for the point the beef is tender and soft but not overcooked. Like can be cut with a fork. A lot of this recipe has been inspired by [this kenji video so follow him for how it should be cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIdlVi-VzPY&t=1378s)

Once the beef is sorted, take it out the oven, then take the beef out, and boil the gravy on the hob till it is reduced to a thick gravy. Once the beef is cool enough cut it off the shortribs and chop into decent mouthful cubes. Once the gravy is reduced return the beef and chill. 

Get some pastry and blind bake in a pie tin, then add in the beef and cook for like 45 mins till the pastry is browned and the filling is hot serve. 

**jerk chicken**

In a blender, add in about 20g of allspice berries, and blend into a powder. Then add in 2 packs of spring onions, a thumb sized piece of ginger peeled, 3-6 large scotch bonnet chillis, 3tbsp thyme, 3tbsp brown sugar, 2tbsp veg oil, and the juice of 2 limes. blend

Get about 8 chicken thighs and legs, and in a big bowl add in the chicken and marinade, and **put on gloves**, and then mix thorougly. Marinade for like 4 hours. 

Get the grill/broiler going on about 1/2 power, and then get the chicken on trays on wire racks above tin foil, with some space between them (might need to do batches), then grill until browned all over and cooked to temp. 

Well worth reserving any leftover marinade as well as any juice/sauce that dripped off while cooking. 

**SOUPS**

**brocolli stilton soup**

dice onions and leeks, and cut brocolli into florets. Fry oniones and leeks, add water/stock and broccoli and cook till cooked, blend then 2 mins before serving add a bunch of stilton or other strong but a bit melty blue cheese. Honestly so depressing seeing all the brocolli cheddar soups from people I feel probably just haven't had it with stilton


**Pea and mint**

Fry off an onion, then once cooked through add in a hefty handful of cashews and cook for a minute, add water and 3 handfuls of frozen peas. Cook for a minute, blend, then add lots of sliced mint, blend again and serve. Can also be done cold if you skip the onion

**potato and leek**

1/2 about 4 leaks, wash them out for any grime, then cut into 5mm slices, and dice a large onion. Peel about 5 large potatoes then dice into dice sized cubes. Fry off  leeks and onion in butter for a while, on a low heat until soft. Add potatoes and cook through in about 1.2l water, or water and a veg stock cube, for about 15 mins until soft. blend, add lots of pepper and blend.",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/5jo8b4/so_i_gradually_build_up_a_collection_of_my/

(For using up leftover jerk chicken from previous comment) 

get a big bowl, and add in 500g flour, 7g yeast, 2tbsp sugar, 1tsp salt, 1tsp baking powder, then mix. Add in 2tbsp veg oil, 50ml milk, 200ml warm water, then mix and bring together, and add more water or flour as needed. Kneed for a while till it's smooth, then rest for a couple hours. If it's a struggle can always leave for an hour or so then kneed again. once it rises to 2x size cut into about 10 pieces, and roll out into ovals. brush the top 1/2 with oil and then fold in half, then place on a square of baking paper. 

Thinly slice 1/2 a red onion, a chunk of cabbadge, 7 spring onions and a carrot into thin julienne, then add in 3tbsp white wine vinegar, a big pinch of salt, and then several big pinches of sugar, and adjust the sugar/vinegar/salt until t's great. 

Get a slice of pineapple per bao you're serving, and cook on high in a pan in oil until browned and cooked through, about 3mm thick. remove

Get a steamer on, and pop in the number of bao you need. In another pan shred up some chicken, and taste and add in some of the dripped off marinade if it needs more flavour. 

Combine the slaw, chicken, optionally some melty cheese, and top with the pineapple, and done.

2016-12-05 00:42:51,submission,recipes,"[Discussion] Slow Cooker curry/Indian dishes, with an eye towards food allergies"," Hi all.  I did a great Tikka masala recipe this evening but canot share it with a friend as it's a minefield of allergens for her and her boys.  The recipe is below.  

I've found a garam masala and red curry paste that I can vouch the ingredients as safe for so that's done, but I'd love some other slow cooker recipes that work on this kind of flavor. Thanks!

Recipe:

1 28-Oz can of crushed tomato (*Allergen!*); 1 large onion cut into chunks; + cup cut carrots; 2 tbsp red curry paste; 1tbsp fresh ground ginger; 3 minced cloves of garlic; 1/2 tsp each salt, ground coriander, and paprika; 1/4 tsp each ground cardamom and cumin; 2 lbs chicken.

Cook those on low 6-7 hours (or 3-3.5 hours on high).

Then mix 1/2 cup half and half; 1/3 cup flour; 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt; 1 tsp garam masala (as long as no cinnamon in it allergen free).  Pour into the chicken mix and cook on high 30 minutes.

2016-12-05 11:25:14,comment,recipes,,"I made a onion and mushroom sabzi - it had garam masala, some hot sauce, tamarind paste, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and some spicy ketchup (but you can omit this for the allergy) 

Cut up the mushrooms and onions, then chuck into slow cooker. Add sauce of choice (I made mine in a wok and added hot sauce, garam masala, chilli powder, tamarind paste, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric etc). You could easily adapt it for a slow cooker. 

Once it is done cooking in slow cooker, what I would do is put a bit of oil on a pan and make it super hot, quickly fry up the mustard seeds until they splutter then put cumin seeds. Work quickly as they will burn! Add curry leaves if you have them (to taste) and take off the heat and add to the mushrooms and onions 

Some people do the last bit first and add everything to it, but not sure how that would work in a slow cooker. Hence why I suggest adding it at the end when they've all cooked :) 

Indian cooking is quite versatile, it can be as simple or complex as you want! Could adapt the recipe and add some meat alongside the veg in the slow cooker.

Also look up tadka dal - easy to make in slow cooker and can eat it with rice or Indian flatbreads 
Check out chickpea recipes, could make a simple chickpea and spinach curry/dal and add some meat alongside that

**Ingredients**

* 1 Tbs extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-2 jalapeños (I used one strangely-large jalapeño), minced with seeds removed for a milder chili and with seeds to make this nice and spicy
* 1 lb organic ground turkey
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp thyme
* 2 cans of beans, rinsed (I like to use a variety of white, black, or pinto beans)
* 1 8-oz can corn
* 1 can pumpkin puree
* 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup sodium-free organic chicken broth
* Optional toppings (jalapeño slices, Greek yogurt/sour cream, cheese)

**Instructions**

* Place 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil in large saucepan over high heat. Once heated, add in 3 cloves garlic (minced) and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Next, add in diced jalapeño(s) and sauté for another 1-2 minutes or until softened.
* Add ground turkey and cook until browned. Then add in 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp thyme. Give it a good stir.
* Finally, add in 2 cans beans, 1 8-oz can corn, 1 can pumpkin puree, 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes, and 1 cup sodium-free organic chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for 30 minutes, or until thickened. Be sure to taste as you go and add a few extra dashes of the seasonings to your taste.
* Once cooked, serve chili and top with optional jalapeño slices, cheese, plain Greek yogurt, or simply just dig in as is.

Not much avocado flavor, but the yogurt/mustard sauce was great!

Ingredients

3 pounds Yukon Gold or red potatoes, quartered

Kosher salt

2 Tablespoons ALDI SimplyNature apple cider vinegar

1 1/4 cups ALDI FriendlyFarms plain Greek yogurt or mayonnaise

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

1/4 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper

4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and diced

2 medium organic avocados, peeled, pitted and diced

half of a small red onion, peeled and thinly-sliced (or diced)

1/2 cup chopped celery (about 2-3 celery ribs)

1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

optional toppings: pinch of chili powder, extra chopped fresh cilantro, extra black pepper

Steps

Place the potatoes in the bottom of a large stockpot.  Fill the pot with cold water until it reaches an inch above the potatoes, then add a tablespoon of salt to the water.

Heat the potatoes over high heat until the water reaches a rolling boil.  Then reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and cooked through.
Remove from heat and strain out the water.  Then once the potatoes have cooled for a few minutes, remove and discard the potato skins.  Then dice the potatoes into small bite-sized pieces, and sprinkle with the vinegar.  Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt (or mayo), Dijon mustard and black pepper until combined.
Add the diced potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, red onion, celery and cilantro to the mixing bowl.  Then very gently toss the potato salad until all of the ingredients are combined and evenly coated with the Greek yogurt sauce.
Garnish with optional toppings if desired.

Serve immediately.  Or cover the salad with plastic wrap so that the plastic is completely touching the top of the salad with no air bubbles, and refrigerate for up to 2 days.  (The avocados may brown slightly after a few hours, but they will still be safe and delicious to eat.)",19,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/4xtha4/avocado_potato_salad_i_didnt_taste_much_avocado/

You can play around with it a lot to change the taste. I put 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard instead of mustard powder. 

Also, did you try shredding the carrots and spiraling some zucchini? It could be the crunch she doesn't like. Buying a ""zoodler"" changed my eating habits. I now love carrots and zucchini in my salad. Have you tried red cabbage in your salad? She might also like that. 

And if she really, really, REALLY hates vegetables, have you tried adding cheese, croutons, seeds or nuts to your salad? Sesame seeds, pecans, etc are all excellent in salad. Fruit is excellent in salad as well. Strawberries, magoes and blueberries are an excellent choice. Of course it all depends on the dressing.

I don't eat meat, but a different way to spice up your salads would be to add bacon or chicken.

2016-05-06 13:55:28,comment,recipes,,"That looks like spinach.

Ok let me get this out of the way I hate salad. I can't say this enough...I really hate salad. Now with that full disclosure let me tell you how I tolerated salad and even, gasp, don't really totally hate it anymore.

You could say you need to take the Hillary Clinton approach to salad here not the Bernie Sanders approach. What I mean by that is that taste buds are a lot like political views. Taste buds can be changed but only with incremental steps which is much easier than sweeping tectonic earthshattering changes.

Now she does not like crunchy stuff. That might not be true but everyone that has been crunchy tastes like the bottom of a shoe to her(insert crunchy sucks). So you have to really start to make this very very small changes and augment the flavors a bit until her palate and mouth feel can get around to not doing the whole ""WTF IS THIS!"".

Short cut to the good stuff is often paved with bacon. This one is really easy and a good tester to see where she is. Get some bacon and your spinach together. Get a green granny smith apple and just a little bourbon and honey. Oh and Parmesan cheese and not that cheap shit, get some actual Parmigiano-Reggiano from the cheese display at the grocery in the block form Christ sake. If it cost less than 8 bucks for the wedge don't get it. Just trust me.

Now mix up the honey and bourbon as a dressing make it taste strength wise however you like. I personally put them in a pot and cook them down a bit but just mixing in a little bourbon with honey will work as well. Keep it on the thicker side.  That is your dressing.

Plate up the spinach, crush up some bacon, drizzle the honey bourbon on it, and grate up the parmesan cheese over it. It will stick to the honey and bacon and make your brain melt. 

Now, as time goes on you start putting less and less honey/bacon/ parmesan cheese in this mix. It is about getting the taste buds used to eating this stuff and you slowly ween out the stuff that kills ya.

Oh, remember the green apple. Use the grater to make shoe string like green apply slivers about the width of spaghetti. They will not be crunchy enough to make her yuk out and everyone loves green apples. Use just enough to not freak her out, start putting more in as she gets down with it. Baby steps.

This gets your texture and mouth feel going. Slowly over time you can very very slightly bring in cucumbers as the sweet honey will mask the weird bite some people don't like. The green apple will help cover it as well. The apple sliver will prep her for the crunch down the road of the cucumbers. 

As you add more cucumbers start adding ginger to your honey. Ginger, bacon, Cucumbers, apple...Christ I want a salad now.",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/4i4n5f/request_when_it_comes_to_salad_my_fiancée_will/

Recipe as follows :-



- To start off we'll make the yogurt, so for that we have 2 liters of warm milk buffalo milk.

 Always boil the milk before making the yogurt. this ensures that the milk does not spoil during the fermentation process.

 The milk should not be hot. If its very hot the milk gets coagulates and you might end up getting a grainy yogurt.

 And also not cold, as the yogurt won’t be able to set at all.

 So just warm milk will do just fine to make a great yogurt.




- Here we have 2 tbsp of yogurt. Which we will mix in the warm milk.

 It is very important to dissolve the yogurt culture uniformly in the milk. Whisk very well with a spoon or a whisker.

 After mixing the culture in the milk place it in a warm spot like a turned off oven to ferment and set for at least 2 hours.




- Since it is hot climate out here, the yogurt has set very fast, place the set yogurt in the refrigerator to chill for 2-3 hours. 




- Now to drain all the water from the yogurt, take a muslin cloth, place it in a large bottom bowl.




- And place the chilled yogurt in it.




- Now what we do here to drain the liquid is to let gravity do its work and hang the muslin cloth filled with yogurt over a sink overnight(3-4 hours is good enough, but the more you let it sit the thicker finished product you get, which is definitely always better :) ).




- The yogurt sans the water after hung overnight in the muslin cloth. The starting 2 liter milk yielded more or less 1 kg of hung yogurt.




- Now on to preparing the Shrikhand, take the yogurt in big bottom bowl.




- Add in about 300 gms(this is wholly up to individual taste, some like it less sweet, some like it more, so adjust the quantity according to taste) powdered sugar.




- And mix it well with a hand mixer, continuously scraping the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Don't over mix it, just enough till you feel the sugar has dissolved, even if you feel there are some lumps remaining, they will dissolve themselves when you put the Shrikhand in the refrigerator to chill.




- Now that our base is ready, I went ahead and made two flavors of  Shrikhand. 

 Firstly my favorite, and as they are in season right now, Mango. So I took a large 250 gms of ripe Alphonso Mango and pureed it in the blender.




- And pour in the mango puree with half of the Shrikhand base.




- Mix it well, and ready to refrigerate.




- The other half is more traditional preparation, add in a teaspoon of cardamom powder, a tablespoon of chopped pistachios and 1/4th a teaspoon of crushed Saffron in the Shrikhand base. Mix it well, and ready to refrigerate. 




- Though the prepared Shrikhand can be eaten as is, what I like to do is freeze it and eat it like Fro-yo. Serve the Mango Shrikhand with some diced up Mango on top.




- And serve the traditional Shrikhand with a sprinkle of chopped up pistachios.

    1/2 cup Brandy
    2 cups Beef Stock
    2 Tablespoons Cornstarch
    1/4 cup Sour Cream, Room Temperature
    1 teaspoon (heaping) Dijon Mustard
    Cooked Egg Noodles, For Serving

Instructions
Season the steak with salt and pepper, then heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add half the meat to the pan and brown it quickly, about 2 minutes. Remove the first batch to a bowl and cook the rest of the meat. Remove and set all the meat aside.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan and add the onion and mushrooms. Cook until the mixture is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the brandy and add 2 cups of the stock. Stir, scrape the bottom of the pan, and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook to reduce the liquid by about a third, 3 to 4 minutes.

In a small pitcher, make a slurry by mixing the remaining 1/4 cup stock and the cornstarch with a fork. Pour the slurry into the skillet and cook until the sauce thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat. Stir in the sour cream and Dijon. Add the beef and stir over low heat until the mixture is nice and piping hot. Taste and adjust seasonings as you like.

2016-04-12 11:58:25,submission,recipes,Cinnamon French Toast Granola (new favorite),"Who doesn’t like french toast? Cinnamon buttery goodness topped with sweet sticky maple syrup. Now imagine that same flavor in the form of a healthy snack. I recently started making my own granola and I just had to share how easy it is. Many recipes I found called for honey but I was craving the deep richness of pure maple syrup, which is how I ended up with a cinnamon french toast flavor (yum!). Quality store-bought granola can set you back anywhere from $6-9 a pound. Homemade granola, however,  is not only simple to make but it’s much more economical too. So here’s to healthy, homemade snacking on a budget!

**Ingredients**

4 cups Quick Oats

2 cups raw sunflower seeds

1/2 cup pure maple syrup

1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/3 cup vegetable or coconut oil

**Directions**

Preheat your oven to 325 F. 

Combine all your ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir well to coat.

Spread the mixture evenly on two sheet pans and pop in the oven for approximately 20 minutes until golden brown. 

While baking, take the pans out every 5 minutes and move the granola around so that they cook evenly and don’t burn. 

Once the granola is done and cooled, seal in a airtight container and enjoy as a cereal, mid-day nibble, or as a yogurt topper.

Done, easy? :)

Sear and crumble beef in a large pot with salt, pepper and Worcestershire, then drain a bit if you like. Separately, saute onions, garlic, serranos and ginger until onions are softened and translucent.  Add to beef along with tomatoes, chick peas, water, ketchup, beef soup base, curry powder and cumin.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer until thickened. Add lime juice and sesame oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Garnish with yogurt, chutney, cashews and cilantro, and serve with naan. And maybe rice.

Indian Chili


	* 1 lb 80/20 ground pork, browned in 1 tbsp ghee or butter
	* 1 green pepper, chopped
	* 1 red bell pepper, chopped
	* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
	* ½ cup frozen corn or corn from 1 fresh cob
	* 1 can diced tomatoes (I added a couple fresh ones as well)
	* 1 6-oz can tomato paste (or a bit more to taste)
	* 1 can garbanzo beans, drained
	* 1 can large butter beans, drained
	* 1.5 cups coconut milk (I used 1 can lower lower fat as it was already super rich and thick)
	* 1 small chunk ginger, minced
	* 4 cloves garlic, minced
	* 1 tbsp ground turmeric
	* ½ tbsp cumin
	* ½ tbsp chili powder
	* 1 tsp salt


Spice blend: (heat all this together on a dry frying pan approximately 1 minute, seeds will begin to “pop” when ready. Then blend to a powder in a grinder)

	* 1.5 tbsp coriander seeds
	* 2 tsp yellow mustard seeds
	* 1 tsp black peppercorn
	* ¼ tsp whole cloves
	* ½ tsp cardamom pod (insides of 1 or 2 cardamom pods)
	* 1-inch of cinnamon stick
	* 6 dried chiles (I used 3 Anchos and 3 Guajillos)


Throw everything in a crockpot and cook on low for 10 hours. Eat!


I sautéed the onions, garlic, ginger, peppers and ground pork before adding the remaining ingredients and cooked on the stove.  It was pretty thick so I added a cup or so of water as well and simmered for an hour and a half.

1/2 pound of zucchini (about 2 small)
1/2 pound of yellow squash (about 2 small)1 teaspoon coarse or Kosher salt, plus extra to taste2 scallions, split lengthwise and sliced thina bunch of chopped cilantro and parsley1 large egg, lightly beatenFreshly ground black pepper1/2 cup all-purpose flour1/2 teaspoon baking powderOlive oil
1 cup light or fat free sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
1 to 2 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
Pinches of salt
1 small minced or crushed clove of garlic

Directions

Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Have a baking sheet ready.
Trim ends off zucchini and squash and grate them using a food processor.
In a large bowl, toss zucchini and squash with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and set aside for 10 minutes. Wring out the water of the vegetables. You’ll be surprised by the amount of liquid that will come out, but this will prevent your fritters from becoming soggy.
Return the zucchini and squash shreds to bowl. Add more salt if you think it needs.
Stir in the scallions, parsley, cilantro, egg and some freshly ground black pepper.
In a small bowl, stir together flour and baking powder, then stir the mixture into the vegetable batter.
In a large heavy skillet heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Drop small bunches of the vegetable mixture onto the skillet only a few at a time so they don’t become crowded and lightly nudge them flatter with the back of your spatula.
Cook them over moderately high heat until the edges underneath are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the fritters and fry them on the other side until browned underneath again, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Drain on paper towels then transfer to baking sheet and then into the warm oven until needed.
If using the topping, stir together the sour cream, lemon juice, zest, salt and garlic and adjust the flavors to your taste. Dollop on each fritter before serving and enjoy!
These fritters keep well, in the fridge for the better part of a week, so that you can enjoy them for breakfast the next morning. When you’re ready to use them, simply spread them out on a tray in a 325 degree oven until they’re hot and crisp again.

**TIME **
* Prep 15 m
* Cook 35 m
* Ready In 3 h 50 m

**Ingredients**

* 1/2 cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt

Moist and incredibly flavored, with the spice from crushed red peppers and the tanginess from the acids in the lemons, these skewers are as good as I have ever had. But what makes it the best for me is cooking this on a BBQ, so when deciding to use this recipe on summer day, consider a BBQ before anything else.

Ingredients:

2 1/4 pound skinless & boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
2 teaspoons of dried crushed red peppers
1 cup Greek Yogurt
3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons of tomato paste
2 teaspoons of coarse kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
6 garlic cloves, peeled then flattened
1 thinly sliced lemon cut into rounds
Bamboo skewers, soaked in water, 30 minutes prior

Procedures:

1) Place the dried crushed peppers in large bowl and mix 2 tablespoons warm water and let sit until a paste forms, which can take up to 5 minutes.
2) Add the yogurt, the olive oil, the red wine vinegar, the tomato paste, 2 teaspoons of coarse salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper to the spice mixture in a bowl, then whisk to blend. Then stir in the garlic and lemon slices, and then add the chicken. Cover with saran wrap and place in a refrigerator for at least 1 hour, but longer is better.
3) Once you are ready to cook the chicken on skewers, light up the BBQ, thread the chicken pieces onto the soaked skewers, spreading equally. Once dressed, sprinkle each skewer with salt and pepper then grill chicken until golden brown and cooked through, turning skewers occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes total. Once complete, transfer the skewers to the platter.
4) Drizzle some Greek Yogurt over the skewers for a final touch and viola!

Now, the actual recipe.

**Ingredients for chicken**

- 1/2 tablespoon paprika (I like to used smoked paprika)
- 1/2 tablespoon cumin
- 4 tablespoons tomato paste
- (optional to make it have a little extra spice, 1/2 tablespoon Harissa)
- 1 1/2 tablespoon yogurt (any natural non flavored)
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 whole lime, juiced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 boneless chicken thighs cut in fourths ""chunk sizes"" (you can also use chicken breast, to duplicate this measurement I've used 6 chicken breast cut into chunks. remember, you're skewering these)
- if you're doing the bread method, 2 large pita breads
- pomegranate seeds and roasted pine nuts for garnish

*Cooking Chicken*

1. Mix together the paprika, cumin, tomato paste, harissa (if using), garlic, lime juice, yogurt, olive oil in a bowl and add the chicken. stir and mix and rub into chicken for a minute or so. cover top of bowl with plastic wrap and place in fridge over night (best results) or off to the side somewhere for 3 hours at room temperature (yes, it's fine.) 
2. pierce the pieces of chicken through the skewers (about 5 or 6 pieces per skewer leaving a small gap between each piece as to cook evenly) cook chicken on a grill or under a broiler for 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through (165+F).
3. if you're grilling the chicken, this would be a good time to put the pita in the oven. if you're broiling the chicken, then wait till the chicken is done.


**For the Lebanese Rice**

- 1 1/2 cups basmati or jasmine rice, rinsed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 3/4 oz 70 grams vermicelli
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 3 teaspoons salt

*Cooking Rice*

1. put rice in a bowl and rinse with water until the water becomes clear.
2. heat oil in a sauce pan or medium sized pot and add the vermicelli and cook, stirring until golden. add the rice, cumin, salt and continue to cook and stirring for another minute or two.
3. pour in 2 cups of hot water and stir for another minute or two, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until all the liquid is evaporated and the rice and vermicelli is tender soft.

*How I like to serve this dish*

take the Lebanese rice and put it on a plate or in a bowl. top with the chicken, pomegranate and pine nuts. add any leftover lime juice, then mix together and drizzle a little bit of tahini or tahini sauce and chopped cilantro over it and enjoy. this goes great with baba ganoush, tatziki or any salad/vegetable side.

  * 1 tsp salt

**For Minted-Yogurt Sauce**

We made ours about 9 hours in advance to let the flavors meld. The key is to really crush the mint to release the flavors. We found that adding all ingredients to the food processor and giving them a quick whirl really helped the flavors come together. After mixing, set in refrigerator until ready to serve.

**For Chicken**

  * Combine all ingredients early in the day and refrigerate. We let ours marinate for 9 hours.
  * One-half our prior to dinner time, heat grill to medium-high and grill for about 6 minutes per side. An instant read thermometer should read between 150' and 160'. Once removed, the breast temperature will continue to rise. The FDA says it should read 165', but you decide how you like it.

**For Eggplant**

  * Slice in 1/2"" thick rounds
  * Brush with olive oil and rub with cumin and salt on both sides of slices.
  * Add to grill when you turn your chicken (after 6 minutes).
  * Turn eggplant after 3 minutes

They should be ready when the meat is ready.

**Ingredients**


5 Tbsp butter


1 pound of top sirloin, cut into thin strips 


1/2 cup chopped onion


1-2 cloves of garlic, chopped finely


2 heaping cups sliced mushrooms (white button, cremini, whatevs)


A few dashes Worcestershire sauce


1/8 teaspoon nutmeg (just a quick dash)


1-2 tsp fresh tarragon, chopped (optional)


1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp beef broth


1 Tbsp corn starch (optional)


1/2 cup sour cream at room temperature (You can substitute plain yogurt for a lower-fat version OR homemade sour cream* for the HELL YES version). Many recipes call for a whole cup of sour cream, but since I add broth, I don’t feel the need for that much.


Salt and pepper to taste

 
**NOTE: Store bought sour cream works just fine in this recipe, but when you up the milk fat to upwards of 30% using whipping cream and make your own…there are no words to describe. Try it - you won’t be disappointed. If you’re going this route, pay close attention to what is in your whipping cream and try to find a brand with no stabilizers or gelatins. This might require a trip to a specialty or organic store. To make sour cream: Heat 1 cup whipping cream to 35 C (95 F), then whisk in 2 tablespoons buttermilk. Let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours, until thickened.**

**Directions**


Sprinkle beef strips with salt and pepper. Melt 3 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet (cast iron if you got it!) on medium heat. Increase heat to high/med-high and add the beef. Brown on each side, watching carefully as to not let the butter burn. Work quickly, as the slices are thin and don’t need much time. Overcooking will make the beef tough. After beef is browned, remove from pan and set aside. Keep those drippings in the skillet!


In the same pan, reduce the heat to medium and add the onion. Sauté for a couple of minutes in the delicious remaining beef fat and then add the chopped garlic. Stir garlic/onion combo for a minute before removing from the pan and setting aside in the same bowl as the meat.


In the same pan, melt the last 2 Tbsp of butter. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook on medium high for ~4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add nutmeg and tarragon (if using). Give a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.


In small bowl, combine 1 tbsp corn starch with 1 Tbsp of broth. Set aside


With the pan still on medium high, add the beef broth and stir to make sure all the last beef bits, onion/garlic goodness, and mushroom flavor is combined in one lovely concoction. While stirring, add the corn starch+liquid mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook ~30 seconds until thickened, then reduce heat to low.


Add sour cream to mushrooms and mix well. Add back in the beef, onion, and garlic and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper as desired.


Serve immediately over your starch of choice. My fav is egg noodles, but mashed potatoes or other starch works too. Garnish with chopped parsley.",69,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/309hgm/beef_stroganoff_with_homemade_sour_cream_easy/

2015-03-25 22:45:48,comment,recipes,,"Most whipping creams are also Ultra Pasteurized (UP) or Ultra High Temperature (UHT) Pasteurized, which produce a less tasty sour cream if the process works at all.

Pasteurization is most destructive of the liquid part of milk, which there's less of in cream, and not the fat molecules. Milk fat/butterfat/butter, is stable at regular pasteurization temperatures. It's the process of homogenization that is thought to destroy the milk fat particles (and separated cream doesn't undergo homogenization).

Let’s get metaphysical (sing along if you know the words, folks).

I was in a metaphysics class (in case you’re wondering: yes, it is impossible to say that particular combination of words without sounding like an asshole) and we got into a debate about what constitutes a martini.  The correct answer, as the professor so rightly explained, was gin, vermouth, and either an olive or a twist of lemon.

That’s it.

Now, to anyone who’s been fortunate enough to read this lovely blog should already know that what I just described is, in fact, a martini, and anything else is blasphemy on a par with executing the Pope in St. Peter’s Square and starting to worship his hat.

But the reasoning she gave, that’s what gave me a little bit of the think-juice.  She said this:

If changing the garnish from an olive to a cocktail onion is enough to change the drink from a Martini to a Gibson, how could a Martini be anything but gin and vermouth?

And she’s right.  100% right.  Right enough to extrapolate it across the board: if changing one ingredient makes enough of a difference to change the name, then you’d damn well better believe each and every one of those ingredients matters.

Granted, that flies in the face of all the times I’ve uttered an emphatic ‘meh’ to my measuring spoons and instead elected to more or less fling fistfuls of vanilla paste at whatever happens to be going into my oven at the time.  But the point remains the same.  Ingredients matter, and they make the biggest difference when they’re distilled down to their purest form.  Keep it pure, keep the ingredients where they belong, and that’s where flavor happens.

That’s why this week we’re going to cook the everloving shit out of a bunch of lemons and shove it inside a lemon cupcake.   And we’re gonna make coconut frosting and top it with more coconut.

Because we’re purists; right?

**Here's what you need:** 


Marmalade:

* 6  lemons
* 1 1/2 cups sugar

Cupcakes:

* 2  eggs
* 1 1/2 cups AP flour
* 1 1/4 cups  sugar
* 1/2 (1 stick) cup unsalted butter (room temp)
* 1/3 cup (plus 1 tbsp) lemon juice
* 2 tbsp milk (2%)
* 3 tbsp grated lemon zest
* 1/3 cup greek yogurt (also 2%)
* 1 tbsp poppy seeds
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
*  toasted coconut cookie thins (for garnish, Trader Joe's has some)
*  toast sweet coconut flakes (also for garnish)

Frosting:

* 1 1/2 tsp coconut extract
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 8 oz cream cheese (room temp)
* 16 tbsp unsalted butter (room temp)
* 2 cups powdered sugar

**Here's how you do it:**

1. First, the marmalade. Juice the lemons and take out the seeds, and make sure you save the juice.
1. I started to cut the peels into thin strips, and then got fed up and threw them into my food processor because I’m lazy. If you have one, I suggest you do it my way. If not, slice the lemon peels nice and thin.
1. Either way you slice it (see, see what I did there? This is why I’m a writer, folks. Comedy gold.), throw the peels into a large pot and cover them with cold water. Bring it to a boil and boil for a minute, then drain them and rinse under more cold water. Do it a couple more times, but don’t rinse on the last pass.
1. Throw the peels back into the pot along with the lemon juice and sugar, bring it up to a simmer on medium, and let it cook for around 30 minutes, giving it the occasional stir. To test if it’s ready, put a ceramic plate in the freezer, put a little bit of the marmalade on it, and stick it back in for a couple minutes. If you can push the stuff on the plate with your finger and it wrinkles up, you’re ready to go. If not, give it some more love on the stove.
1. While that’s happening, you can get to work on the cupcakes.
1. Start by preheating the oven to 350.
1. Get a bowl and whisk together the dry stuff: flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
1. Get another bowl and do the same thing with the yogurt, milk, vanilla, and lemon juice.
1. Put the butter and sugar in your stand mixer and cream them together on medium for 2-3 minutes, until they’re light and fluffy.
1. Mix in the eggs one at a time, then the lemon zest.
1. Next, mix in the dry stuff and the wet stuff, alternating until it’s all in there.
1. Stir in the poppy seeds, put the batter in a cupcake tin, then throw it into the oven for about 30 minutes. Let them cool for 5, then let them cool some more on a cooling rack while you make the frosting.
1. This part’s easy: cream together the butter and cream cheese in your stand mixer until they’re…well, creamy. Then add the other frosting ingredients and mix. Even a monkey could do it.
1. Once the cupcakes are at room temperature, scoop out a tablespoon from the tops of each and fill them with that sweet, tangy marmalade.
1. Frost the cupcakes, top with the toasted coconut, and stick a cookie in the top of each. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of pastry-physics the cookies get all soggy and gross if you keep them in the cupcakes for long, so you gotta put them in the day you eat them.

As always: thanks.

Ingredients:

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 onion, thinly sliced

1 medium eggplant (1 pound), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes

2 garlic cloves, minced

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, preferably hot

Pinch of crushed red pepper

Kosher salt

3/4 pound ground lamb

1/4 cup tomato paste

3/4 cup chicken stock

8 ounces gemelli

1/2 cup whole plain Greek yogurt

1/3 cup chopped mint

Directions:

In a large skillet, heat the oil. Add the onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 minutes. Add the eggplant, garlic, oregano, cumin, paprika and crushed red pepper and season with salt. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the lamb and cook, breaking up the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in the stock and bring to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat until the sauce is thickened, 12 minutes.

Cook the pasta in a pot of salted boiling water until al dente, 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Stir the pasta and 1/4 cup of the reserved cooking water into the sauce; add more water if a thinner sauce is desired. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the yogurt and mint. Season with salt and serve hot.

I liked this a lot. The cumin added flavor, but it wasn't overpowering or super strong. The lamb was a nice change from ground beef.",17,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/2z2i5m/cumin_lamb_noodles_with_eggplant/
2015-03-10 19:26:41,submission,recipes,Chocolate avocado cookies. Super delicious and healthy!,"Source and pictures: [The Golden Cookbook](http://goldencookbook.com/2015/03/10/chocolate-avocado-cookies/)

**Ingredients:**

* 1 ripe avocado

* 1/4 cup brown sugar

* 1/4 cup granulated sugar

* 1 egg

* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

* 1/2 cup flour

* 1 tablespoon vanilla

* Kosher salt to taste

**Notes:** 

For a healthier recipe, use coconut sugar as opposed to regular sugars; leave out the flour or use coconut flour. For a vegan recipe, leave out the egg, use a flax egg or use vegan yogurt. Although I have not personally tried this, I’ve heard of others having success with using yogurt as an egg replacement. For lower sodium, leave out the salt. You could also try adding coconut oil to these recipe. I had success with my chocolate chip cookies. You can never go wrong with coconut products. Also, dark chocolate is much healthier than milk chocolate, so if you want to replace the chocolate, be sure to go for dark chocolate. If you want even more antioxidants, add some dark chocolate chips  directly to the batter.

**Method:**

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
* Mash the avocado and add sugars. Mix thoroughly.
* Add baking soda and cocoa powder. The dough should be very sticky, so mix with a wooden spoon.
* Add egg and vanilla. Room temperature eggs are preferred. Quickly bring an egg to room temperature by placing it in a glass of cool water for a few minutes. Continue to mix.
* At this point add flour. If you like a super gooey cookie, feel free to add less flour. I don’t like the dough to be messy, so I would recommend adding more flour. It’s still a sticky dough, but the flour will make it easier to deal with.
* I would recommend greasing the cookie sheet. These chocolate avocado cookies do leave a mess, but they came off pretty easily for me without using oils to grease the pan. The choice is yours. Use a spoon to scoop golf ball sized cookies onto the pan. I like dough that is easy to handle with my hands, but this is too sticky for that.
* Top with a few flakes of kosher salt. I probably had about 10 flakes per cookie. You don’t want to use too much. Since the chocolate avocado cookies don’t have any salt baked in, the kosher salt is meant to draw out some of the flavor. Salt is always a good accompaniment to chocolate.
* Bake for 6-8 minutes. These chocolate avocado cookies don’t flatten as much as normal cookies, so you should have big poofs of deliciousness. They cook pretty fast, so don’t leave them in for more than 8 minutes unless you want a more solid cookie.
* Let cool before enjoying. Store in an air tight container in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.

**[Imgur Album for the Visual Learners](http://imgur.com/gallery/DFpbD)**

To be upfront, I'm able to do this in part because a very kind fellow redditor, /u/chromiselda, manager at [Regency Spices](http://regencyspices.hk/), donated a sampler pack of their [Indian Spices Starter Kit](http://regencyspices.hk/starter-kits/indian-spices-starter-kit) to me. This isn't paid advertising or anything, but I think it's right to show my appreciation to him for his awesome gift by noting where most of the spices in these recipes are from!

Now, onto the food! Here are three fabulous Indian dishes we all know and love--made a little healthier where possible. So, get ready to learn how to make **Chana Masala** *(Vibrant chickpeas cooked in a thick, spicy-tangy curry)*, **Butter Chicken** *(Tender white meat chicken simmered in a delicately spiced, creamy tomato sauce)*, and as a bonus, **Bhaturas** *(Puffy, fluffy, crispy fried Indian breads, perfect as a once-in-a-blue-moon treat!)*.

##Chana Masala (Chole)
*Vibrant chickpeas cooked in a thick, spicy-tangy curry; ~6 servings; doubles well*
###Ingredients
* ½ lb Dried Chickpeas, soaked overnight with two teabags (or at least 6 hours) and boiled with ½ tsp Salt in 1 gallon water until “squishably” soft—probably 1 – 1 ½ hours; reserve cooking water
* 3 tbsp Oil
* 2 Bay Leaves
* 2 1” sticks Cinnamon
* 2-3 Green Cardamom Pods
* 3-4 Cloves
* *(Optional)* 2 blades Mace
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 2 medium Onions, finely diced
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (or 1 ½ tsp each Ginger and Garlic, minced) [Recipe here](http://imgur.com/a/BWPSt)
* 1-2 Green Chilies, diced
* ½ tsp Turmeric Powder
* 1 tbsp Chana/Chole Masala Powder (or make your own with the below combination)
  * 1 tsp Coriander Powder
  * ½ tsp Cumin Powder
  * ½ tsp Red Chili Powder
  * ½ tsp Amchur Powder (powdered dried Mangos)
  * ½ tsp Anardana Powder (powdered dried Pomegranate Seeds)
* 1 tsp Coriander Powder
* *(Optional)* ½ tsp Red Chili Powder
* 1 cup Pureed Tomatoes (about 4-5 Roma Tomatoes)
* ½ - ¾ cup Chickpea Cooking Water
* 1 tbsp Cilantro, chopped

###Directions
As in the ingredients, soak ½ lb of dried chickpeas in enough water to cover by 2-3” overnight, along with 1-2 small teabags (just basic black tea) added in; these will dye and mildly flavor the chickpeas. The next day (or 6+ hours later), bring about a gallon of water to a boil with ½ tsp of salt in it. Add the chickpeas and cook until they are completely soft—you should be easily able to squash them between a finger and your thumb. Drain them, reserving some of the cooking water for later. You can cook the teabags with the chickpeas for a much more striking color, but I find cooking tea that long lends a slight bitter flavor, and fishing them out is sort of troublesome!

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat your oil over medium heat. Add the bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, mace, and cumin seeds, and fry, stirring, for about 30-45 seconds, until very fragrant and sizzling noticeably. Add in the onions and salt and mix everything together, and then cook (stirring frequently) until the onions are darkening noticeably—at least 10-12 minutes. Add in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes to cook out the raw flavors in the paste. Then, add in the green chilies and cook another 1-2 minutes more.

At this time, add in your dried, powdered spices: the turmeric, chana masala, coriander, and red chili powders. Stir them into the onion mixture and sauté for about 30 seconds; if the mixture is too dry and sticking badly, add water to prevent it burning, as burnt spices will make the entire dish unpleasantly bitter.

Then add in the tomato puree and simmer, covered, at least 8-10 more minutes to cook the tomatoes well. Afterward, add in your chickpeas and some of the reserved cooking water to your desired consistency. Mash a few of the chickpeas with your spoon and then boil for about 5-10 minutes until thickening and flavorful. Finally, stir in some cilantro and—if you like your chana masala tangy—1-2 tbsp of fresh lime juice. Serve hot with bhaturas and/or basmati rice!

##Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)
*Tender white meat chicken simmered in a delicately spiced, creamy tomato sauce; ~6 servings; doubles well*
###Ingredients
* 1 ½ lb Chicken Breast, chopped into bite-sized pieces or thin slices
* ¼ cup Plain Yogurt
* ½ tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Ginger-Garlic Paste
* 1 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder (or Paprika for less heat)
* 1 tsp Coriander Powder
* 1 tbsp Lime Juice
* 1 tbsp Oil
* 2 tbsp Butter
* 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 2-4 Green Cardamom Pods, bruised (partially crushed)
* 1 medium Onion, finely diced
* 1 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (or 1 ½ tsp each Ginger and Garlic, minced) [Recipe here](http://imgur.com/a/BWPSt)
* 0-2 Green Chilies, finely diced
* *(Optional)* 2-3 tbsp Cashew Nut Paste (add small amount of boiling Water to Cashews, soak 5-10 minutes, then blend into a thick, smooth paste)
* 1 tsp Salt
* ½ - 1 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder
* ½ tsp Cumin Powder
* 2 tsp Coriander Powder
* 6 (large) – 9 (small) Roma Tomatoes, pureed—about 2 cups (Optional: skin and seed first for silkier gravy)
* ¼ - ¾ cups Water
* 1 tsp Sugar
* 1 tbsp Kasoori Methi, rubbed to a fine powder by hand
* 1 tsp Garam Masala
* ¼ - ½ cup Cream or Plain Yogurt (healthier)
* *(Optional)* 2 tbsp Butter
* 1 tbsp Cilantro, chopped

###Directions
Combine the chicken pieces, yogurt, ½ tsp salt, ginger-garlic paste, Kashmiri chili powder/paprika, coriander powder, and lime juice and marinate for at least 2 hours (but up to 8). When finished, heat oil in a wide skillet (or large pot/Dutch oven, if you’d like to make this a one-pot recipe) over medium-high heat and brown the chicken pieces (it’s alright if they don’t completely finish cooking at this stage). Remove the cooked chicken and reserve.

In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt your butter over medium heat. Once it mostly stops sizzling, add in the cumin seeds and cardamom pods and fry for about 20-30 seconds before adding in the diced onions. Cook for approximately 8-10 minutes until soft and beginning to slightly brown. Add in the ginger-garlic paste and cook a further 2-3 minutes to reduce the raw flavors of ginger and garlic. If using, add in the green chilies and cashew nut paste, then cook an additional 1-2 minutes. If, at any point, the mixture dries out and starts to stick, add a couple of tablespoons of water.

At this time, add in your initial powdered spices and seasonings: salt, plus Kashmiri chili, cumin, and coriander powders. Stir to combine with the onion mixture and fry for about 30 seconds. Add in the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for at least 8-10 minutes, until tomatoes are darkened and drying out. At this point, add water to achieve your desired texture (and, if you’d like, blend smooth with an immersion blender, removing the cardamom pods first).

Add the chicken pieces and simmer for 5 minutes or so to cook through and meld flavors. Add and stir in the sugar, kasoori methi, garam masala, cream or yogurt, additional butter (if using), and, finally, the cilantro. Sample a bit of the sauce to test the seasoning, then serve hot with basmati rice and fresh, buttered naan.

##Bhaturas
*Puffy, fluffy, crispy fried Indian breads; ~6 large pieces*
###Ingredients
* 2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida)
* ¼ cup Semolina Flour (Sooji)
* ½ tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Sugar
* ¼ tsp Baking Soda
* ½ tsp Baking Powder
* ¼ cup Plain Yogurt
* Water as needed (~¼ - ⅓ cup)
* Oil for frying

###Directions
Combine the AP flour, semolina, salt, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl and stir together well. Mix in the yogurt, incorporating it into the entire mixture. Then, ideally by hand, mix in lukewarm water until the mixture comes together in a stiff, thick dough. Don’t worry about making it perfectly smooth yet, but do knead it briefly—about a minute.

Cover with a little oil (a tsp or so), then cover the bowl with a dish towel or similar and set the dough aside in a warm place to rise for approximately 2-3 hours.
When it’s nearly risen, begin heating oil in a large pot or deep fryer to about 350-360F. The proper temperature can be tested by tearing off a small pinch of dough, flattening it into a little disc, and adding it to the oil: if it’s the right temperature, the dough fall to the bottom of the pot, then begin bubbling and rise to the surface almost immediately.

Divide the dough into balls—somewhere between golf ball and lemon-sized, depending on your preference for the final product’s size—and roll each one smooth, then press flat. If it’s slightly sticky, barely flour it. In any case, then roll the discs of dough into thin, flat rounds—somewhere in the vicinity of the thickness of a flour tortilla or a crepe. The most important thing is to get them evenly thin.

Add each round of dough to the oil one by one. Using a spider or other heat-proof cooking spatula/spoon, press the top of the dough down into the oil. This action will eventually coax one or more large bubbles out of the bhatura; use the tool to squeeze the bubbles down to even them out across the entire surface of the dough, making a puffy balloon-like shape. Don’t worry if you can’t get giant spheres every time; even a few smaller bubbles add a wonderful texture to the finished product! After 30-45 seconds of frying (or once the side in the oil is crispy and browning slightly), flip it and cook until the bottom is also golden brown and crispy.

Fry each piece of dough similarly, and then remove each to paper towels to dry and cool slightly. Serve them, still warm, with Indian curries like chana masala.

2015-02-21 12:17:29,submission,recipes,How to make Achari Chicken (Pickle Spiced Chicken),"**Achari Chicken** is full of pickle flavor, tangy and appetizing.

**Watch the Making Video of Achari Chicken - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXyeIf11Szw**

In this recipe video you will learn about pickle spices which is a blend of five aromatic spices. The recipe quantities will allow you to make so many achari dishes.

Try some other variation by adding paneer, mushroom or other vegetables and share your experience with me.

**Before making this dish, make sure you go through these tips:**

* 1. Pickle spice or Achari masala is known as panch phoran in Bengali cooking. In almost every dish we must add this to enhance the flavor and taste. So these spices are very special in Bengali cuisine.
These paanch phoran or five spices consists of cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, onion seeds, fennel seeds and mustard seeds or rai in equal parts. But I personally add little amount of  fenugreek seeds as it has bitter taste. In this recipe, dry roast all these spices and make a fine powder. Store it in an airtight container.

* 2. Use mustard oil to get best and flavorful achari chicken.
* 3. I added less oil but actually the dish is made in lot of oil. When it is health concern I try to put less oil.

* 4. I will suggest you to not to make gravy of the achari chicken.
If you add water you will not get that pickle taste. Usually the pickle that we have is dry, tangy, flavored with many spices and imerse in oil. No moisture or water is there. So our achari chicken should be like that.

#Ingredients

**Ingredients for achar masala/ Blend of pickle spice:** 
* Whole cumin/ zeera: 1 tsp
* Fenugreek seeds: 1/2 tsp
* Onion seeds (Kalonji): 1 teaspoon
* Fennel seeds: 1 teaspoon
* Mustard seeds: 1 teaspoon
* 2 tbsp roasted coriander flakes

**For Achari Chicken:**

* 2 Slitted green chilies
* 1bay leaf
* 5 dried red chilies
* 2 big onion thinly sliced
* Chicken - 500 gm cut into medium pieces
* 10 crushed garlic cloves
* 2 tsp ginger paste
* Pickle spice powder
* 1 cup yogurt
* 2 tbsp red chili powder
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp cumin powder
* 1/3 tsp garam masala powder
* Juice of 1 lime
* 1/2 sprigs of chopped cilantro

#Instructions

* 1. First heat mustard oil.
* 2. When the oil comes to smoking point add slited green chilies and fry them. Once done, take out.
* 3. Now Turn the flame low. Temper the same oil with five spices -cumin seeds, very little fenugreek seeds else it will make the dish bitter, few onion seeds, fennel seeds and mustard seeds or rai.
* 4. Just a saute and allow the spices to release it's flavor. But be careful so that they don't burn.
* 5. Add whole dried red chilies and bay leaf go in there. Gentle stir again.
* 6. Now add sliced onion. Cook until they are are lightly golden brown.
* 7. Crush 7-8 garlic cloves in a mortar pestle and add it. Saute till fragrant.
* 8. Now 2 tsp ginger paste. Cook well until raw smell go away.
* 9. In a separate bowl add yogurt. To this add red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, crushed coriander or coriander flakes and garam masala powder. Whisk it and directly pour in the pan.
* 10. Cook until yogurt mixture separate from the oil.
* 11. Then add the main ingredient - chicken. Cook on high flame for beginning 10 minutes.
* 12. Then cover and cook on low flame for 20 minutes. After every 7-8 minutes open the lid and check again so that it doesn't scald.
* 13. After 20 minutes of cooking In this way the chicken will become nice, tender, juicy and has changed it color into dark brown. The oil has will separate too.

2015-01-19 21:27:54,submission,recipes,[Recipe] German Heritage Breakfast Wraps.,"This recipe will yield a savory wrap with traditional European breakfast flavor profiles like summer sausage, egg, smoked gouda, and saurkraut.

Ingredients

Summer Sausage
Smoked Gouda Cheese
Mushrooms (I use portabella)
Hot Sauce (I use Huy Fong Sriracha)
Saurkraut (drained)
Tomato
Eggs
Tortillas

**Step 1**

Prepare a frying pan with spray grease.  Prepare a cutting board and chef knife.

**Step 2**

Dice Gouda and summer sausage in a one to two ratio.  Slice a few portabella caps.  Combine in frying pan over medium heat.

**Step 3**

 Add hot chile sauce to taste (note that the Gouda will significantly reduce the intensity of the heat).  Add a dash of tap water, and simmer over low heat.

**Step 4**
While the pan simmers, prepare diced tomatoes, drained sauerkraut, tortillas, and an egg.

**Step 5**

Once the runny cheese/water/hotsauce/oil mixture thickens, add eggs.  The volume of egg added should be about 3/4 of the volume of all other ingredients in the pan excluding egg.  Gently scramble.

**Step 6**

As eggs cook, prepare tortillas with a generous bed of saurkraut and about one thick slice of diced tomatoes per.

**Step 7**

Portion scrambled eggs, sausage, and gouda from the pan generously onto the tortillas.  Wipe out pan with paper towel, roll the wraps, and toast in the still-hot frying pan.  

**Step 8**

Serve the savory wraps (very filling) with orange juice, yogurt, and fresh fruit.  Enjoy.

2015-01-07 23:55:52,submission,recipes,Confession: I grew up a coddled picky eater.,"And I need more vegetables I don't hate. I figured y'all would have some good recipes that can showcase the flavor of new foods, but still be simple. I'm open to almost all fruits (except that shifty bastard kiwi), and most meats that won't demolish my insides (lookin at you, red meats). Eggs, in small doses, are okay. I am mildly lactose intolerant; milk is not my bro, but I can cook with it and be fine, and cheese and butter are good. Yogurt is a no-go.

Vegetables I'd like to get to know:

Zucchini and other squashes (this one especially, there are so many recipes that feature zucchini. Do I like zucchini? Who knows!)

Eggplant (or is that a squash?)

Cauliflower (is it even tasty?)

Spinach (fresh, I can't handle the smell of cooked)

Kale (really trying to find a way to like this one, ""in a smoothie"" is not one of them)

Brussels sprouts (my SO loves them, so they're probably in my future)


I already enjoy broccoli, green beans, potatoes (love of my life), corn, peas, carrots and I'm sure more I can't think of. 
So throw some of your best recipes at me!

Fry bacon, retain the grease, slice a bunch of clean Brussels sprouts in half, dunk them in grease and spread them onto a cookie sheet with foil.  Bake until brown, and flip them to brown the other side. (bake flat side up at first for easier flipping, they are less likely to stick that way).  Use tongs to flip, or a fork in each hand.

Slice, give it 15+ minutes to marinate (olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper) and grill it fairly hot. Or, again, roast it. Pretty much the same recommendations for the summer squashes (softer than winter squash, and don't keep as long) like yellow squash and patty pan squash (cute little minis, IMO slightly firmer and less watery than zucchini or yellow).

Winter squashes like butternut (not my favorite), kabocha (my fav, it's sweet), pumpkin (find one meant to be cooked, not for Halloween) are quite hard and difficult to cut into. Treat them like a sweet potato - roasted, steamed, mashed, soup, pan fried/sauteed, slow cooked in butter or stock, doused in butter and soy sauce, [simmered like this](http://justbento.com/handbook/johbisai/frozen-kabocha-squash-plus-easy-simmered-kabocha-squash), stir-fried. Does not have to be served sweet, not all winter squashes are sweet, they can be savory and can go well with garlic.

Eggplant is more closely related to nightshades like tomato than it is to squash, but for cooking techniques I'd treat it like a summer squash. Also: it can be bitter sometimes, so salting before cooking is often recommended. Classic dishes often include frying, as for eggplant parmesan, or mashing like for baba ghanoush. 

IMO, cauliflower is just ok - if I have the option, I'll always pick broccoli instead. Kind of has a mealy texture. Maybe buy a bag of mixed carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli and try it? That way you're not investing in a whole head of the stuff. Roast them all together, or make a gratin, or again with the sauteing.

For spinach, I tend to stick with baby spinach as it's a little more tender and good to eat raw. Something like hot spinach (+- artichoke) dip or creamed spinach might not smell so bad to you? (Or again, try with baby spinach instead of mature? IMO it can really make a difference.) Cold spinach vegetable dip is another way, or as salads. Baby spinach, thinly sliced red onion, mandarin oranges, sweet poppy seed dressing or vinaigrette. Baby spinach can be a good replacement for lettuce in sandwiches, or as a filling for baked casserole things like enchiladas or lasagna. [Coconut Chickpea Spinach stew is really good](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-braised-coconut-spinach-chickpeas-with-lemon-164551)

[Kale salad?](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2014/05/kale-citrus-salad/). I think it can also be used cooked in some of the same ways as spinach, and is supposed to hold up well in soups. [Here's some recipes](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/03/kale-recipes-we-love.html)

Hey, guys! I hope everyone’s weekend has been wonderful! Tonight I decided to make a dish that was a spin on potato skins! I love potato skins at restaurants, but often, they’re loaded in fats and calories! These are much healthier, and have a lot more substance to them! These are perfect as an appetizer, tailgate food, or even as an entrée!

Garlic Chicken Potato Skins

Servings: 4 (1 skin per serving)

Amount per serving: 89 calories—10g carbs—1g fat—10g protein

Ingredients:

2 russet potatoes (nutrition content reflects only 1 medium sized potato due to excess lost during cooking)
1 clove garlic—minced
2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese
4 oz chicken breast
2 tablespoons non-fat plain Greek yogurt
 

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cookspray.

Poke holes into potatoes and microwave for 10 minutes.

When the potatoes are done, cut them in half and spoon out the middle (you can save the middles for mashed potatoes!)

Place the potatoes on the cookie sheet and spray the tops of the potatoes with cooking spray.

Sprinkle the garlic and parmesan cheese evenly in the potatoes and bake for 10 minutes.

While the potatoes are baking, cook the chicken on the stovetop. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.

Shred chicken and put into potatoes when they are done.

Top with non-fat plain Greek yogurt and enjoy!

These were so yummy! They had just the right amount of garlic flavor, and the chicken made them filling enough for a meal!",38,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/2jbkgu/garlic_chicken_potato_skins/

Here’s something you fine, educated folk might not agree with.

Your opinion is wrong if you can’t back it up.   Period.  It’s not a bad opinion, it’s not a misinformed one, it’s *wrong*.

People try to act like their opinion matters all the damn time, but for some reason it pisses me off the most when people talk about food.  Am I gonna sit here and argue that taste isn’t subjective?  Of course not.  There’s no way everyone is gonna like the same stuff, and they’re probably going to have decent reasons for the difference.   Maybe you don’t like avocado because it’s slimy and mushy, or he thinks Snickers are better than Milky Ways because they have those commercials where Betty White yells at a small child or whatever the fuck it is.  And that’s fine, *as long as they have reasons at all*.

But there’s some people who think opinions are asterisks instead of arguments, and that’s some bullshit.  And you’ve definitely ran into one of these assholes before (or you *are* one of those assholes, in which case you should close this window and go read Reader’s Digest or whatever it is you simpletons like to shove into your eyeballs).  The people who argue that the ice cream place on 3rd is THE best place, that no other joint in town has a better scoop and anyone who says otherwise is a blithering idiot.  But as soon as you try to argue back and say that no, no, the place on 5th and Crenshaw is obviously *way* better because they have that awesome sea salt caramel flavor, they come back with a line that makes my very *being* itch with annoyance:

“Whoa, it’s just my *opinion*, man.”

BULL.  SHIT.  You don’t get a free pass because you suddenly decided to wave the white “opinion” flag.  See, by calling that ice cream place or steak joint or whatever it may be the best thing ever, the best thing since the fucking genesis of mankind, you’re implicitly calling every other place worse.  *By definition*.  You don’t get that shit for free; you have to explain *why* all those other places are shit.  And not only that, but you’re subject to criticism if your reasons suck.

I know this is a rant, like most of these intros are.  But it’ll be relevant in a few lines, I promise.   All I’m saying is that a lot of people think they get a free pass when they let the word “opinion” spill out of their stupid , malformed mouths, and I wanna make it clear that they’re wrong.  Food’s too important to let people get away with that nonsense.

The reason I’m talking about all this in the first place because this week’s recipe has something that nearly everyone I know has one of these “opinions” about: gin.  If there’s one thing on this earth people are just flat-out wrong about, it’s gin.  It’s delicious and it’s magical, but people think that just because the one time they had it was mixed with grape powerade at a sorority mixer, it’s automatically garbage.

No, *you’re garbage*, gin-hater.  And that’s why I’m showing you how to do it right.

**Here’s what you need:**

Galette:

- 5 red delicious apples
- 2 ½ cups AP flour
- ½ teaspoon salt (+ an extra pinch for the apples)
- 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter (you want it somewhere between ice cold and room temp)
- 1/4 cup greek yogurt
- ½ tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 1/3 cup ice water
* 3 tablespoons demerara sugar
* ¼ cup sugar + 2 tablespoons
* ¼ cup light brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
* 1 egg

Sorbet:

* 2 cups sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1 ½ cups meyer lemon juice (about 8-10 lemons)
* 2 tablespoons meyer lemon zest
* 2 bunches fresh basil
* 1 teaspoon rose water
* 3 ounces gin 

Note:  Start this off the night before you want it.  I know some of you people don’t bother to read the whole recipe before you start, and then get mad and confused when you hit the “refrigerate overnight” part.  That’s why I’m putting it here.  Now stop complaining, dammit.

First, the sorbet.

Heat up the sugar and water in a medium pot over high heat, and stir until the sugar’s been completely dissolved (that means clear, folks).

Take it off heat, and add in the basil and lemon peel.  You can be a lazy son of a bitch like me and throw the whole bunches of basil in at once; that’ll make it easier to take out later.

Cover the pot and let it cool to room temperature, then take out the basil.  DON’T strain out the lemon peel; most recipes tell you to do that, and they’re wrong.  Lemon peel’s delicious, and it’s even more delicious when it’s in a mouthful of sorbet.

Put the sugar-water in whatever you plan on chilling this stuff in, and mix in the lemon juice, rose water, and gin.  Refrigerate it overnight (aren’t you glad I warned you now?).

Once the sorbet stuff is all nice and cool, give it a run through your preferred ice cream mixer and stick it in the freezer while you make the galette.  Be sure to mix up the sorbet a few times while it’s freezing, that way all the tasty gin won’t sink to the bottom.

For the galette, whisk together the flour, salt, and two tablespoons of sugar in a large bowl.

Add the butter in, and cut it in with a pastry cutter until you get a vaguely pebbly texture.

Whisk together the yogurt, vinegar, and ice water in a small bowl and add it into the dough.

Mix together the dough with a wooden spoon or your hands or…pretty much anything, really.  If things are looking a little too dry, add a little more ice water.

Once you’ve got your dough formed, roll it into a ball, flatten it into a disk, and wrap it in plastic wrap.  You know what’s coming: stick it in the refrigerator overnight.

Preheat your oven to 400.

Dust a cutting board or flat surface with a little flour and roll out the galette dough to about an 1/8th of an inch thick.  Keep in mind that this is a galette; they’re supposed to look like shit.  Don’t worry about making it the perfect beautiful circle of dough; just get it to where it needs to be.

Prepare the apples by peeling them, slicing them thin with a mandoline, and tossing them in a large bowl with a ¼ cup of sugar, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.  Work fast so they don’t get brown and mushy.

Pile the apples in the middle of the galette dough, leaving a couple of inches around the apples free to fold over.  You’ll probably have more apples than you need, so take some off if you can’t fold the dough.

Fold the dough over the apples, leaving a small, open hole in the middle.  And don’t snicker at that last sentence…I’m watching you.

Crack the egg in a small bowl and add a tablespoon of water.  Whisk them together and use the egg wash to brush the top of the galette with a pastry brush.

Sprinkle the demerara sugar on top of the galette.  You want a lot of this stuff so it gets all nice and caramelized, so if 3 tablespoons isn’t enough, add more.

Stick it in the oven on a baking sheet for 35-40 minutes, let it cool off for 5, then stick it on a cooling rack until it’s cool enough to eat.

See you next time, folks.

2014-09-02 16:05:19,submission,recipes,Mint and Coconut Chutneys,"Mint and Coconut Chutneys can be prepared in just ten minutes in the blender, and provide a healthy way to add flavor to any meal quickly. A staple condiment in Indian cooking, these chutneys can be used as dips for raw vegetables, or as an accompaniment to fish and chicken.

**Ingredients**

*For the Mint Chutney*

* 2 cups fresh mint (hard parts of stems removed, packed tightly, this is about 3/4 of a bunch)
* 1 jalapeño pepper (stem and seeds removed)
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
* 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons coconut oil (melted)
* 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 small shallot (or 1/4 of a small onion)

*For the Coconut Chutney*

* The leftover remnants of the mint chutney in the blender
* 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (moistened with 2 Tablespoons of water if dried)
* 1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt (regular or greek)
* 1 small red pepper, stem and seeds removed (or 1 jalapeño pepper, stem and seeds removed)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 small shallot (or 1/4 of a small onion)


**Instructions**

* Before you get started, if you are using dried coconut it is helpful to sprinkle some water over the coconut to moisten it, but not more than 2 tablespoons. It only needs a few minutes, so by the time you finish making the Mint Chutney it will be ready to use.

* First, make the Mint Chutney:  In a blender, combine the mint, lemon juice, jalapeño pepper, sugar and salt and blend until smooth. Then add in the coconut oil, garlic and shallots and blend until you have a smooth puree.  Transfer the mint chutney into a serving dish, but DO NOT CLEAN THE BLENDER. You want to leave whatever you didn't pour out as the flavor base for your Coconut Chutney.

* Next, make the Coconut Chutney:  In the blender, combine the coconut, yogurt, pepper, and salt and blend until smooth. Then add in the shallot and blend until you have a smooth puree. Transfer into a second serving dish and enjoy!

**Notes**

* Yields 1/2 cup Mint Chutney, and 3/4 cup Coconut Chutney

* This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled, depending on the amount you need. When doubled, the Mint Chutney is an especially good marinade for baked chicken.

* Can't find coconut oil? Any neutral oil will do, like canola oil or even light olive oil, which doesn't have much flavor.

* Both chutneys will keep in the refrigerator for 5 days, but for any longer you can freeze them in small Ziploc freezer bags or tupperware. To defrost, run the Ziploc bag under warm running water, or simply let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight.

1. Marinade the chicken in lemon juice, paprika, and half the yogurt for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

2. Heat the oil in a large fry pan over a high heat. Brown the chicken and set aside. Return the pan to the heat, reduce to medium and fry the onion, garlic, and chili in the butter for about 3 minutes. Add the garam masala, cardamon, cinnamon, and cumin and cook for 1 or 2 minutes, stirring constantly until fragrant.

3. Return the chicken to the pan, add the tomato paste and chicken stock. Simmer for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is reduced and the chicken cooked through.

4. Add the cream and the rest of the yogurt. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Season with salt to taste.

2014-07-15 22:06:21,submission,recipes,HEALTHY NO-BAKE Banana Peanut Butter Oreo™ Bars,"HEALTHY, well healthier than the original just so I could use Oreo cookies!

Ingredients

CRUST
12-16 Oreos™
3 TBSP of unrefined coconut oil
1/2 C cacao nibs (if you cannot find them semisweet chocolate chips) melted
FILLING
4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese
1/2 C creamy all-natural peanut butter
1/2 C plain Greek yogurt
1/3 C powdered sugar
1 - 2 tsp of vanilla (I tend to do a messy tsp which is right in between)
chopped peanuts & course sea salt

Instructions

For the crust: Line an 8"" pan with tinfoil, shiny side down, and lightly coat with cooking spray.
Get ride of aggression by smashing up the Oreos™ in a Ziplock™, or a bowl or whatever you have till you can fit them in a food processor and really blend them down. The Oreos™ are not healthy, I know this and so if you don't want the Oreos™ just get the chocolate wafers and blend them till crumbling (24 wafers) in the food processor but with all the healthy substitutes you can have Oreos™, I give you permission).
If your coconut oil is at room temp, just zap it in the microwave for no more than about 20 seconds, if it is straight out of the fridge 30 seconds TOPS, you don't want it bubbling. It has a much lower melting point than butter, so keep that in mind. (Coconut oil is used as a 1:1 substitute for all butter in recipes in my house, even melting it and putting it on my popcorn with a dash of sea salt). Add it to the cookie crumbles and process again in pulses so the cookies are coated; add the melted cacao nibs and process until the mixture is the texture of very wet sand. (Cocoa nibs are just as good as chocolate in baking and ten times as healthy for you.)
Using an offset spatula (the flat metal ones used to frost your cakes evenly), press the mixture firmly and evenly into your pan.Cover and place in the fridge while you create the sexy creamy filling. Oh, clean that processor bowl out, you will need it!

For the filling and topping:

Add the cream cheese, peanut butter, yogurt, sugar and vanilla to the bowl of the food processor and process until smooth and combined. (the vanilla replaces 1/2 your sugar and knocks down the calories plus adds a rich wonderful flavor without the filling being to sweet)
Pour the mixture over the crust and smooth with a spatula. Top with the peanuts and sprinkle with 1/4 tsp course sea salt.
Cover and return to the fridge until set slightly looser than cream cheese, about 4 hours up to overnight.
Use the spatula to separate from the edges of the tinfoil and you will be able to cut it up into a nice solid dozen bars. High in protein, healthy enough to feed your lover two and help with the energy to go another round, I mean on a longer walk. :) These need to be stored in the fridge and not left out on the counter for to long or they will get all melty messy like, unless you want to have to help clean him up ;)
Notes

I created this when I saw the new peanut butter Oreos™. I wanted to be able to have sweets without feeling guilty, have a low fat recipe of the already labeled healthy dessert recipes (I am guessing Greek yogurt and chocolate wafers instead of the Oreo™ cookies) Food Networks favs and yet have the decadence of the Oreos™. I have tried it with the wafers, and they were great! But I liked this crust better, the texture tended to be closer to the peanut butter without it being a mess. The coconut oil makes it rich and even more flavorful than butter and oh so much healthier (plus it makes me feel less guilty about not using the wafers).

2014-05-13 07:04:38,submission,recipes,60 Awesome Ways to Spice Up Boring Chicken Breasts (compiled from around the web),"Edit: Original link is here : [http://greatist.com/health/healthy-exciting-chicken-breast-recipes](http://greatist.com/health/healthy-exciting-chicken-breast-recipes)

“Oh chicken breast, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways… ”

Despite being packed with protein (which helps our bodies build and repair tissue and keeps us feeling full longer) and versatile in the kitchen, chicken breasts often get knocked for being boring, tasteless, or just plain not good. But I guarantee that these 60 delicious recipes from around the web will breathe new life into the not-so-hallowed bird.

>“ These recipes will have you looking at (chicken!) breasts in a whole new way. ”

These chicken breasts recipes use common household ingredients and healthy cooking methods like baking and grilling to add new zest to chicken breasts. Forget what you thought about the meat. These recipes will have you looking at (chicken!) breasts in a whole new way.

**Sauces**

1. Chicken with Tomato Herb Pan Sauce
Crushing tomatoes as part of dinner prep? Oh yeah. Fresh herbs give chicken breasts extra zing, while savory cherry tomatoes are heated until they burst, finished off with a dash of wine, and then poured over the chicken. In short, this sauce makes “plain” chicken so very not plain.

2. Chicken with Dijon Mustard Sauce
Mustard: not just a sandwich condiment. Dijon mustard complements poultry perfectly, and this dish is no exception. Combine it with fresh thyme, salt, pepper, some white wine, and garlic, and you’ve got yourself a main course that’s perfect to serve with roasted potatoes, over pasta, or on salad greens.

3. Chicken Breasts with Lime Sauce
Pair this chicken breast with a healthier margarita, because this lime sauce is out of this world. Cut down on prep time by purchasing thin-sliced breasts at the store.

4. Chicken Breasts with Mushroom Sage Sauce
For a recipe that uses only easy-to-get-your-hands-on ingredients (such as mushrooms, cream, and shallots), this sauce is lip-smackin’ good. Sauté the veggies in a pan with your oil of choice and white wine (save the rest of the bottle!), while browning the chicken breasts separately. Add some fresh herbs to the sauce, pour it over the breasts—and voila! Your restaurant-worthy dish is ready.

5. Seared Chicken with Lemon Herb Pan Sauce
No washing piles of dishes here! This chicken comes together all in one pan. Seared chicken, fresh herbs, and zesty lemon pull this meal together in just 20 minutes. Have some bread handy to dip in the extra sauce!


**Rubs**

6. Brown Sugar Spiced Baked Chicken
A quick, sweet, and savory dinner doesn’t get easier than this. Preheat the oven while you coat chicken in a blend of sugar, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, oregano, and superfood garlic. Bake for 20 minutes, and enjoy.

7. Cayenne-Rubbed Chicken with Avocado Salsa
When you want to make something easy, this fits the bill. This cayenne-spiced chicken gets topped with a fresh, tasty salsa and stars avocado, which comes with its own benefits—it can improve cholesterol levels and is loaded with vitamins E (yay, antioxidants!) and B6 to help keep your skin looking good. Not too shabby for a dinner!

8. Chicken Breasts with Spicy Rub
If you like heat, this chicken is for you. Up the spice quotient by using more rub. Not ready to fire up the grill? Feel free to bake or sauté in a pan—you’ll still get all the zesty flavor.

9. Cocoa and Curry Rubbed Chicken Breasts
Hershey’s for dinner? Believe it or not, using cocoa powder intensifies the taste of the cumin and curry powder in this simple rub, without leaving behind a chocolate-y taste (We’ll leave it up to you to decide whether or not that’s a good thing.).   

10. Spice-Rubbed Grilled Chicken with Everything Sauce
A simple rub that can be used on chicken breast—or other meats—ups the ante with an accompanying sauce made with superfood Greek yogurt, honey, and Dijon mustard. Don’t let the long list of ingredients intimidate you, because this meal comes together super easily.


**Marinades**

11. Jamaican Jerk Chicken with Optional Jamaican Red Beans and Rice
Packed with strong ingredients such as allspice, sage, and nutmeg, the taste of this chicken will transport you to Jamaica (even if you’re stuck in another polar vortex). Serve with optional red beans and rice to round out this Jamaican-inspired meal.

12. Cilantro Thai Grilled Chicken
A marinade that requires only 15 minutes and imparts delicious Asian flavors? Sign us up. Be sure to let the chicken rest for five minutes after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute and keep the breasts moist.

13. Greek Marinade for Grilled Chicken
The perfect marinade for a Greek chicken salad or souvlaki, this recipe uses regular ole’ garlic and common herbs like oregano and thyme to give each bite a burst of flavor, while lemon juice, red wine vinegar, and salt tenderize the chicken.

14. Hawaiian Grilled Chicken
This chicken will conjure up thoughts of sunshine, grass skirts, and fresh island flavors. If you like coconut-flavored foods, this recipe is calling your name. We love the trick of poking the breasts with a fork to ensure the marinade seeps in.

15. The Best 4-Ingredient Chicken Marinade
So simple yet so tasty, this marinade will keep chicken breasts juicy while grilling. Who knew that brown sugar, vinegar, oil, and soy sauce could produce something this good?


**Salads**

16. Healthy Avocado Chicken Salad
We couldn’t write a list of chicken recipes without mentioning chicken salad! The secret ingredients in this version are our dear friends Greek yogurt and avocado. Lime juice and cilantro give a fresh, light taste. Eat it on its own or in a wrap (as pictured above). 

17. Fall-Inspired Grilled Chicken Salad
Cajun-spiced chicken tops a salad made with fresh greens, crunchy apple slices, crumbled goat cheese, and trail mix. Tossed with an easy-to-make homemade maple-mustard vinaigrette, you’ll love this no matter what season it is.

18. Healthy Thai Chicken Salad
Loaded with unexpected ingredients like protein-packed edamame, coleslaw, and superfood quinoa, this Thai-inspired salad gets drizzled with a peanut-y dressing. Sprinkle chopped peanuts or cashews for extra texture, or just gobble down as-is!

19. Lemony Chicken Breast with Cucumber Feta Salad
While the chicken marinates for 20 minutes, toss together this creamy-crunchy salad. While the chicken cooks, the flavors in the salad meld, coming together for one healthy, hearty main course. The next day, throw leftovers in a wrap for a new spin on lunch.

20. Strawberry and Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad
Balsamic vinaigrette pairs perfectly with superfood strawberries, and acts as the star in this light salad. (Optional) bacon and pecans add a little crunch, and goat cheese gets sprinkled on top for a meal that’s as nice to look at as it is to eat.


**Sandwiches**

21. BBQ Chicken Grilled Cheese Sandwiches
Just when you thought grilled cheese couldn’t get any better, this recipe came along. Gooey cheddar and barbecued breasts turn a childhood favorite into an adult classic. Use a pan or Foreman grill if you can’t get to an outdoor grill—the chicken will still be delicious.

22. Baked Crispy Chicken Sandwiches
Forget fast food sandwiches—this homemade version tastes just as good and is ridiculously easy to make. The chicken stays juicy while baking thanks to a quick 20-minute marinade. Feel free to skip the accompanying aioli—or use plain Greek yogurt in place of the mayo if you want a healthier spread.  

23. Buffalo Chicken Club Sandwiches
If you need a buffalo wings fix, this sandwich will do the trick. It takes less than 10 minutes to prepare, and you can use any leftover chicken in a salad or wrap. If you’re counting calories, leave off the optional mayo, bacon, and blue cheese.

24. Chicken Pesto Sandwich
This pesto sauce gets whipped up quickly in the food processor (or blender) and then combined with Greek yogurt for extra creaminess before topping the chicken. Spread on a baguette and top with tomatoes, arugula, and fresh mozzarella (optional) for one of the simplest, tastiest uses for leftover shredded chicken ever.

25. Grilled Honey Lime Chicken Sandwiches
Honey and lime might sound like a weird combo, but trust us: It works. They’re the main ingredients in this simple chicken breast dressing. Served with a veggie-heavy slaw, it’s a complete meal.


**Soups and Stews**

26. Chicken Tortilla Soup
It’s everything you love in a taco, but in a broth that’s packed with Mexican flavor! This soup makes a great alternative to your typical taco or fajita night. Don’t forget the healthy toppings, such as avocado, diced red onion, cilantro, and salsa or pico de gallo.

27. Chicken with Tomatoes and Mushrooms
This super simple stew tastes so rich, you’ll swear it has more ingredients than the mushrooms, tomatoes, chicken, and seasonings that comprise it. Serve over rice or with a slice of crusty bread. 

28. Chinese Chicken Noodle Soup with Sesame and Green Onions
For a unique take on regular old chicken noodle soup, try this version. Traditionally Asian flavors such as sesame oil, chili-garlic sauce, and soy sauce give this easy dish some intense taste.

29. Clean Eating Chicken and Dumplings
The country favorite gets a whole food makeover. This stew is loaded with celery, carrots, and onions (and chicken, of course!), while the dumplings are made with whole-wheat flour. Whether you make it in a crockpot or on the stove, it’s got that homemade flavor that makes the dish so darn good.

30. Cure-a-Cold Spring Chicken Soup
This recipe tastes like the chicken soup mom or dad used to make when you were younger, but with a much speedier cooking time. Make this the next time you have a case of the sniffles—chicken soup is scientifically proven to help ward off congestion and inflammation.

31. Spicy Asian Chicken Noodle Soup
Veggies and herbs give this soup a fresh flavor, while sriracha keeps things spicy. As a bonus, this recipe uses rotisserie chicken to make preparation even quicker.

32. Pesto, Chicken, and White Bean Soup
Meat lovers, rejoice! This soup has chicken and sausage in it (but feel free to leave out the sausage if you have a smaller appetite). Brown your meat(s), add veggies and broth, and then stir in beans and pesto to top off this hearty, protein-rich soup.

33. Quick Irish Chicken Stew
St. Patty’s day can come any day of the year with this tasty stew. It’s loaded with veggies such as potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms, and a variety of fresh herbs jazz up the broth.

34. Simplest Chicken and Leek Stew
Just a touch of sour cream and Dijon mustard give this quick stew a tangy taste. Leeks, mushrooms, and fresh thyme add texture, nutrients, and a whole lot of flavor.

35. Creamy Chicken Stew
When you’re in need of some TLC, this stew is an awesome alternative to chicken noodle soup. Chicken and vegetables cook quickly while you make a creamy sauce with the help of some flour—and then you serve it all with (optional) biscuits!


**Pizza**

36. Healthy Chicken Tamale Pizza
Is it Mexican or is it pizza? It’s both—and it’s good! The gluten-free cornmeal and egg crust is super easy to make, and it gets covered with refried beans (or black bean puree) instead of tomato sauce, shredded chicken, and enchilada sauce. The best part is that you can play around with all the ingredients to suit your taste. Go wild!

37. Homemade BBQ Chicken Pizza
This pizza is the equivalent of a party in your mouth. Tangy barbecue sauce, zesty onions, and two types of cheese make this one a winner.

38. Pizza-Stuffed Chicken Breast
Skip the whole crust business and stuff all the best parts about pizza straight into the chicken breast! Surprisingly satisfying, this pizza chicken is awesome on a bed of greens—or on its own.

39. Spicy Chicken Pizza
This recipe uses a spicy marinade to make a chicken pizza that’s out of this world. Use your favorite store-bought dough to make this more quickly, and add or subtract vegetables based on your preferences.

40. White Chicken Pizza
A pizza without tomato sauce? You won’t miss it in this white version. Once you have a bite of this spinach, basil, and garlicky chicken pizza (topped with as much or as little gooey cheese as you’d like), you just might not go back to the red-sauce varieties.  


**Oven-Baked**

41. Sweet Honey Baked Chicken Bites
… Because everything tastes better in miniature form. These sweet and spicy breasts are easy to make and, thanks to their size, work perfectly as an appetizer.

42. Moist Cheddar-Garlic Oven ""Fried"" Chicken Breast
Can anything with cheddar and garlic be bad? These breasts get that fried chicken flavor in every bite without the mess of actually… frying. Pro tip: Uncover for the last 10 to 15 minutes of baking to crisp up the breading.

43. Lemon Thyme Roasted Chicken Breasts
Lemon steals the show in this dinner-party-worthy dish. Cook the chicken with the skin on to keep it juicy, then remove the skin.

44. Buffalo Chicken Salad with Creamy Avocado Ranch Dressing
Baked buffalo chicken is the star in this salad—and it’s so good you might find yourself making it for other meals, too! If you’re a fan of buffalo wings, you will love this recipe. Using a wire rack will keep the breading intact. If you’ve got the time, whip up a healthier dressing on our own—use plain Greek yogurt in place of the mayonnaise to keep things light.

45. The World’s Best Chicken
This recipe’s title makes a bold claim, but when you combine the taste of this chicken and the fact that it’s totally foolproof to make, it’s definitely a strong contender. A sweet-and-tangy mixture of mustard, maple syrup, and vinegar gets poured over chicken breasts. Bake for half an hour, sprinkle on some fresh rosemary, and you’re done. Serve with a side salad for a complete meal.


**On the Stove**

46. Thai Green Curry
Fast, spicy, good: This green curry will wake up your taste buds and satisfy a Thai food craving. Still hungry? Pour extra sauce over rice.

47. 15-Minute Pesto Chicken Breast
Three ingredients, 15 minutes, and 100-percent delicious: This pesto chicken breast is great over (whole-wheat) pasta or in a salad.

48. Skillet Chicken Parmesan
An alternative to traditional labor-intensive chicken parm, this version comes together with pantry ingredients on the stove for a 30-minute meal. Rachael Ray would be proud. 

49. Stovetop Barbecue Chicken
Use your favorite barbecue sauce (store-bought or homemade) and a handful of spices for juicy, barbecued chicken without the grill.  

50. Butter Chicken
No need to order takeout when you can make this Indian favorite right at home. Serve over basmati rice and be amazed that you made dinner before delivery would have arrived.


**Stuffed**

51. Spinach and Feta Stuffed Chicken Breast
This recipe does Popeye proud. A heap of spinach is sautéed with onions, garlic, and spices, and then mixed with feta and protein-rich ricotta. The chicken then gets breaded (with whole-wheat crumbs!) and baked to perfection. Serve with a simple side salad for a green-friendly dinner.

52. Broccoli and Cheese Stuffed Chicken
This isn’t the steamed, boring broccoli you ate as a kid. Here the veggie gets an adult makeover when it’s stuffed in chicken along with Swiss cheese (use as much or as little as you’d like) and breaded with whole-wheat crumbs. And with just seven ingredients, making this is a snap.

53. Herb-Stuffed Chicken Breast
Using fresh rosemary makes all the difference in this super simple recipe. When combined with a touch of Canadian bacon and goat cheese, its flavor really shines. And with just four ingredients, this recipe is a great for those nights when you’re wondering what to make for dinner.

54. Asparagus-Chicken Roulades
Forget a side of vegetables—this chicken comes with them inside. Vitamin-rich asparagus are placed inside chicken breast halves along with a smidge of goat cheese. After cooking for a few minutes on the stovetop, the chicken gets drizzled with a simple pan sauce for a quick weeknight dinner.

55. Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Stuffed Chicken Breast
Two types of cheeses (as much or as little as you’d like), tomatoes, and basil make this weeknight-friendly chicken feel like it should take much longer to prepare.


**With Fruit**

56. Pineapple Chicken Teriyaki
Pineapple gives this homemade teriyaki sauce a natural sweetness. If you like things saucy, you might want to make an extra batch of sauce to pour over sautéed veggies and/or rice as well.

57. Coconut-Crusted Chicken with Mango Salsa
This showstopper will help you pretend you’re in the tropics. Coconut chicken is great on its own, but adding mango salsa makes it even better. The recipe calls for frozen mango, but if fresh is in season, it’ll lend extra sweetness.

58. Grilled Chicken Breasts with Spicy Peach Glaze
Plain grilled chicken gets a little more interesting with a spicy fruit glaze. Don’t miss out on the grilled peaches, either—they really give the chicken some extra “oomph.”

59. Chicken Breasts with Fruit Salsa
Kiwi, pineapples, and (superfood) strawberries for dinner? You’ll touch on a few food groups when protein-rich chicken gets combined with a zesty fruit salsa in this recipe. It’s quick too—make the salsa while the chicken sautés for 4 to 6 minutes, and then coat the chicken in it. Dinner’s ready!

60. Spicy Apricot Glazed Chicken
How do four ingredients manage to taste so good? As the chicken broils, brush the easy-peasy glaze on—and you’re done. If you’re not an apricot fan, try a different flavor of jam to suit your tastes.

1.Preheat oven to 350.

2. Get one of those Pyrex casserole dishes. The big rectangle ones. 

3.  Cut up some potatoes. I use russets.  I leave chunks the size of golf balls.  Pile them down one long side of the dish. 

4.  Take chicken breasts and arrange them in the middle. 

5.  Open a few cans of green beans and pile the along the remaining edge opposite the potatoes. 

6.  Sprinkle the contents of an Italian salad dressing packet all over everything. 

7.  Slice up some butter and place it every three or four inches all over. You can melt a stick and drizzle it if you want. 

8.  Cover with foil and bake for an hour, maybe an hour and fifteen minutes. 

9.  Take it out of the oven and eat it. 

This is my favorite chicken dish by a huge margin. I love it as much as I love steak, roast, and almost as much as spaghetti.

2014-05-13 14:20:18,comment,recipes,,"My favourite, easy way of making delicious chicken breasts (actually just made them):

Cut a slit into the breast, which will later be stuffed. Optional slits on the underside to soak up more flavour.

Marinate in a mixture of olive oil, lemon, (hot sauce if desired), rosemary, garlic, pepper and salt for at least an hour. 

Stuff the slit with a little stick of butter, some chopped up garlic, fresh sprig of rosemary and a slice of lemon rind. Wrap tightly in bacon (I use rashers, most common bacon cut in the UK) and brush with more olive oil. 

Place in the oven and bake (usually takes about an hour at 200C). I like to place mine on a wire rack above a baking tray because I don't like soggy chicken swimming in runoff oil, water and fat. You can, however, easily baste the chicken with this liquid. Turn over at least once to bake the underside bacon. When 2/3 done, brush with honey and replace back in the oven until it's ready.

The end result is tender, aromatic chicken. The lemon rind becomes soft and edible, and makes for a good stuffing. The bacon, in turn, is crisp and sweet. 

Not the spiciest of recipes, but most definitely easy and delicious. I've just made a kilo of chicken this way for a family of three (7 chicken breasts) and it's already gone.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/25fizf/60_awesome_ways_to_spice_up_boring_chicken/

Oven: Cook it dry at tree fiddy for 20 then crank it to 5 hundo. Let rest, add sauce after rest. Cooking times will very. 

If its in a soup, just cook it! Its fucking soup.

If its grilled make sure your bird is room temp. Fire or gas, it should be hot on one side, not on the other. Cook the outside till it looks like a black Angus commercial. Use tongs. Move the chicken, to the less warm area. Away from flame compleaty. Close that lid. Wait 20. Times with very, touch it...it it firm? Its done. Rest add sauce.

Fry: dont fry, youre on a diet, but if you do bread it with protien powder.

2014-05-08 11:44:24,submission,recipes,100-Calorie Snacks Recipes That Actually Satisfy Your Hunger,"Healthy eating isn’t all about calorie counting. Nutritious foods are key, but sometimes it’s nice to know you can grab a quick snack that doesn't deliver an entire meal's worth of calories. The next time hunger creeps up when it’s least convenient (like 30 minutes before a dinner reservation), turn to this list for a small and satisfying bites that won’t ruin a healthy day.

1. Cheesy Popcorn:
 Toss 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper with 2 cups of freshly popped popcorn. Choose a low-fat, low-sodium pre-packaged variety or pop kernels in a small paper bag in the microwave. Grated parm can have a lot of salt, but one tablespoon has only three percent of the daily recommended value, and only 22 calories for a whole lot of added flavor.

2. Cottage Cheese and Cantaloupe:
 Top ½ cup of low-fat cottage cheese with ½ cup of diced cantaloupe. That ½ cup of cantaloupe delivers 50 percent of the daily recommended values of vitamins A and C, two vitamins that may help promote clear skin.

3. 14 Almonds: 
Almonds don’t need any extras to be a satisfying snack. Added bonus: They’re the most nutritionally dense nut (which means they have the highest concentration of nutrients per calorie).

4. Baked Apple: 
Baked apples can get all dressed up and filled with oats, nuts, and other tasty stuff. But for a simple low-cal version, core a tennis-ball sized apple, dust with cinnamon, and bake at 350 for 20 minutes (or until tender but not mushy).

5. Jicama and Honey Mustard Dip: 
Jicama (pronounced, hic-kuh-muh) is a root veggie that touts 6 grams of fiber per cup. Peel and slice up 1 ½ cups, and dip into a mixture of 1 tablespoon of Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon of mustard, and 1 teaspoon of honey.

6. Mexican Potato:
 There’s always the option to bake a potato, but for a quick snack version turn to the microwave. Pierce a medium potato (about the size of a computer mouse) a few times with a fork, and microwave on high for about five minutes or until soft (you should be able to pierece with a knife and remove without any resistance). Top ½ of the potato with 1 tablespoon of salsa and 1 tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt (a great stand in for sour cream). Save the other half in the fridge for another snack!

7. Kettle Corn:
 Toss 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of stevia with 2 cups of freshly popped popcorn. Try shaking it all up in a paper bag or a container with a lid on it for even topping distribution. Not a fan of stevia? Swap it for 1 teaspoon of honey plus 1 teaspoon of water microwaved for 20 seconds to thin it out.

8. 22 pistachios:
 These little guys are the biggest bang for your calorie buck. Pistachios rank high in protein and lower in saturated fat compared to many other kinds of nuts. Pick the in-shell variety (not the pre-shelled ones) — they’re less expensive and one study found people consume up to 41 percent more calories from pistachios when they don’t have to crack the shell to work for it.

9. Apples and Cheese:
 Pair a Laughing Cow Mini Babybel Light cheese wheel with half of a baseball-sized apple, sliced. The cheese has 6 grams of protein and 20 percent of the daily recommended value of calcium.

10. Red Pepper and Goat Cheese:
 Slice up one medium red pepper and enjoy with 2 tablespoons of soft goat cheese. Goat cheese is tangy and flavorful, and has about ⅓ fewer calories, and ⅓  the fat per ounce compared to cow’s milk cheese.

11. Chili-Lime Shrimp:
 Toss ten large boiled shrimp in 1 tablespoon of limejuice. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of chili powder. Here’s the kicker: this little snack has over 10 grams of protein! Shrimp also have a high concentration of the antioxidant astaxanthin, known to reduce inflammation.

12. Carrots n’ Hummus:
 Chow down on 10 baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus. Jazz it up with fresh herbs like dill or parsley.

13. White Bean Salad:
Combine ⅓ cup of white beans with 1 tablespoon of sliced scallions, a squeeze of lemon juice, and ¼ cup of diced tomatoes. White beans are a good source of dietary fiber, protein, and iron.

14. Hard Boiled Egg Whites and Mustard:
 Boil four eggs for 12–15 minutes. Let them cool, de-shell them, slice them in half, and remove the yolks with a spoon. Sprinkle with pepper and dip in 1 tablespoon of mustard. The really yellow kinds of mustard get their color from turmeric, an anti-inflammatory spice. Pro tip: If you add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to the water, the eggs will be a cinch to peel!

15. Frozen Grapes:
  Grapes make a great snack fresh or frozen, but if you opt for the chilly state, they last way longer. Nosh on 1 cup (about 28 grapes). Feeling fancy? Use them as fruity ice cubes in a tall glass of water to stay hydrated while snacking.

16. Egg Whites and Toast Toast one slice of whole-wheat bread and top with 2 scrambled egg whites. Sprinkle with a dash of pepper and paprika.

17. Pumpkin Yogurt:
 Combine ½ cup of nonfat plain Greek Yogurt with ¼ cup of pumpkin puree. Sweeten with stevia, ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract, and a pumpkin pie spice blend (or cinnamon). Pumpkin is a low fat way to increase this snack’s fiber and flavor profile.

18. DIY Chunky Apple Sauce:
 Dice up ½ of a tennis-ball sized apple and add it to ½ cup of unsweetened apple sauce. So much apple! You’ll get the spoonability of apple sauce, but with an added fresh crunch (not like that store-bought mushy chunk). Sprinkle with some cinnamon for an extra flavor kick.

19. Watermelon Salad:
 Top 1 cup of raw spinach with 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and ¾ cup of diced watermelon. Spinach has a ton of vitamin K (which helps blood to clot properly when you get cuts) and vitamin A (which is good for the eyes).

20. Open Faced Turkey Sammie:
 Toast 1 slice of whole-wheat bread and spread with 1 teaspoon of honey mustard. Top with 2 slices of deli turkey.

21. Avocado Rice Cake:
 Top a rice cake (we like the unsalted brown rice variety) with 1/4 of an avocado, mashed. Sprinkle with cracked black pepper and paprika. Avocados are a good source of monounsaturated fat, the kind of fat that can help improve cholesterol levels and decrease the risk of heart disease

22. Strawberries and Goat Cheese:
 Pair 10 large strawberries with 1 tablespoon of soft goat cheese. This serving of strawberries has over 100 percent of the daily recommended value of vitamin C.

23. Rice Cake and Almond Butter:
 Top a rice cake with 2 teaspoons of almond butter. While it’s not nearly as popular as peanut butter, almond butter is a better choice when it comes to fiber, iron and especially Vitamin E.

24. Enlightened Bars:
 These healthier ice cream bars aren’t just low in calories — they actually have some impressive nutritional stats: Eight grams of protein, no artificial sweeteners, only three grams of sugar, and five grams of fiber per bar. They come in coffee, fudge, and orange cream flavors. (We’re partial to the coffee flavor at Greatist HQ — surprise, surprise.)

25. Kiwi and Coconut Slice:
 1 large kiwi and top with 1 tablespoon of unsweetened shredded coconut. One kiwi has all the vitamin C to meet the daily recommended value.

26. Cukes and Cream Cheese:
 Cut one medium cucumber into long strips. Combine 2 tablespoons of diced roasted red pepper, 2 tablespoons of low-fat cream cheese, and ¼ teaspoon of cracked pepper. Spread the cream cheese mixture onto the strips. Cucumbers are made up mostly of water, which makes them a healthy low-calorie dipper.

27. Broccoli and Tzatziki Sauce:
 Whip up a quick tzatziki-like sauce by combining 2 tablespoons plain nonfat Greek yogurt, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of minced cucumber. Dip six florets into the sauce. The healthy bonus here is that eating broccoli raw may help maintain the green veggie’s cancer-fighting nutrients.

28. Baby Corn and Soy Sauce:
 For a super quick snack, dip 20 baby corns into low-sodium soy sauce. Baby corn is high in folate, a B-vitamin that helps produce and maintain new cells.

29. Dark Chocolate:
 This snack doesn’t need any friends  — it’s tasty by itself. Enjoy three squares or five dark chocolate kisses. A bit of the dark stuff can help regulate levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

30. English Muffin and Fruit Butter:
 Toast ½ of a whole-wheat English muffin. Top with 2 teaspoons of pumpkin butter or apple butter for about 30 calories. Choosing these spreads over conventional jams can save about 20 calories per serving.

31. Protein Shake:
 Shake up 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk. This one’s perfect for post-workout snacking, too — whey protein has been shown to help rebuild muscles after exercise.

Choose a low-fat, low-sodium pre-packaged variety or pop kernels in a small paper bag in the microwave. Grated parm can have a lot of salt, but one tablespoon has only three percent of the daily recommended value, and only 22 calories for a whole lot of added flavor.

I make popcorn on the stove with some oil, add a lil butter, nutritional yeast, and salt. Absolutely delicious, but I guess it goes over your arbitrary 100-calorie limit.

**Streusel**

1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon

1/4 cup packed light brown sugar

3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (I prefer mini chocolate chips)

1/2 cup chopped pecans (or walnuts), optional

**Muffins**

1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 tsp ground cinnamon

3/4 tsp baking powder

3/4 tsp baking soda

1/4 tsp salt

1/2 cup granulated sugar

6 Tablespoons butter, softened to room temperature

1 large egg

3-4 Ripe bananas

3 Tablespoons vanilla yogurt

**Chocolate Chips**



Combine the ingredients for the streusel in a small bowl and set aside.

Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, & salt and set aside.

Beat butter and sugar together until fluffy, mix in egg until well combined and then add the bananas and yogurt  (I prefer to squeeze the bananas while still in within the peel, it gives the bread a better consistency).  Fold in dry ingredients until well combined and fold in chocolate chips. 

This is where you can assemble the muffins based on preference.  I have assembled multiple ways and they always end up being delicious.  You could put half the batter in the muffin tin, put half the streusel over the batter, place the rest of the batter on the streusel and finish with more streusel.  Or, simply top each muffin with steusel.  

These muffins really are amazing.  They have a great banana flavor and have the perfect texture!

One filling is sautéed spinach. It works really well as a side dish. Spinach has an affinity for eggs, so if you serve this as a side consider mixing in some chopped hard boiled eggs. 

More information on this at my blog. 

http://madebyyouandi.com/2014/03/23/sauteed-spinach-for-can-you-guess-yet/

**Western Version**

* 1 or 2 bunches of freshly stemmed spinach blades
* 1 or 2 slices of bacon (for the fat in your recipe)
* 1/4 cup very thinly sliced or minced onions or 1 shallot thinly sliced
* a few drops of lemon or vinegar to taste
* salt to taste
  
**Indian version**

* 1 or 2 bunches of freshly stemmed spinach blades
* 1 or 2 tablespoon butter, ghee, or flavorless oil (butter works best 1:1 with oil)
* up to 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds
* a few drops of lemon juice or up to a tablespoon fresh unflavored yogurt
* 1/4 cup very thinly sliced onions (optional)
* salt to taste

**Japanese Version**

* 1 or 2 bunches of freshly stemmed spinach blades
* 1 or 2 tablespoon butter, ghee, or flavorless oil
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* up to 1 teaspoon sugar
* a few drops vinegar
* salt to taste

**Method:**

Fry the bacon until the oil is released, remove from the pan, add onions or shallots and cook until well browned. Add the spinach and cook coating in the fat, off the heat, add lemon/vinegar, salt, and the bacon chopped fine. Cool for the pie or serve.

Put the oil in the fry pan on high. Add the cumin seeds and when they pop add the onions (if using) and cook until they're brown, then add the spinach and stir constantly mixing them with the flavored oil until they wilt, off the heat, add lemon juice and salt. Taste. Alternatively, add yogurt and salt then taste. Let it cool for the pie or serve.

Heat oil in try pan, add spinach and cook until wilted. Add soy and sugar and toss until the liquids have evaporated off. Add salt and vinegar, mix and taste. Cool for the pie or serve.

I cut the squash in half and rubbed a little EVOO on them.  Then I roasted at 400 for about an hour. While they were cooking I put the walnuts in the blender with yogurt and milk.  After the roasting was done and the walnut mixture made I mixed everything together and took the immersion blender to it.  Initially I didn't add the vinegar, but it needed something.  It really brought out the flavor of the squash.  ",53,41.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1qrcl1/i_am_going_to_give_out_frozen_home_made_soup_for/

1 cup Unsweetened Coconut Milk
1 cup Unsweetened Almond Milk
1/4 cup Egg Beaters (or equivalent egg substitute)
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 tbs vanilla extract
1/4 to 1/2 cup of non-caloric sweetener*

* You can use a blend of equal parts Granulated Splenda (not the baking or powdered kinds), Erythritol, and Xylitol which gives a nicely balanced consistency. (Leave out the Xylitol if you have pets).

* You can also substitute other kinds of sweeteners for 1/4 of the blend (malted milk powder, sugar free coffee syrups, sugar free milk/ice cream syrups).  

* I tend to mix it up as I make different flavors. For example, I've used a 1/4 sugar free peppermint syrup to make a chocolate mint ice cream.

Once everything is all mixed together, put it in your ice cream maker and mix like regular ice cream.  It will end up with a consistency more like gelato or frozen yogurt. 

You have to eat it all. Once it's frozen solid, it is nearly impossible to thaw out enough to eat easily.

**Salad Ingredients** 
 
* Kale (Healthier than lettuce, and delicious) 
* Onion
* Lamb
* Green peppers
* Tomatoes  (I'm not a fan of raw tomatoes, but most people are)  
* Feta Cheese
* Flour Tortillas 

**With the salad ingredients** 

1. Chop all the the veggies, and combine in a bowl
2. Cook the lamb and let it rest.
3. Cut lamb into cube and add it to the salad.
4. Take flour tortillas and slice them into small stripes.(about the same width as a fettuccine noodle) 
5. Fry them in a pan of hot oil. (This will be your pita crouton) 
6. Fry until brown. Strain well. Add a little salt. 

*Don't add croutons or feta to the salad until you're ready to eat!*


**Dressing Ingredients**

* One cup Greek yogurt strained 
* One cup sour cream
* One Large Cucumber.
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* Fresh Dill.
* Tbsp of Olive Oil
* Tbsp of Vinegar 

**With the Dressing ingredients**

1. Seed the cucumber and dice into small cubes
2. Combine cucumber with all other dressing ingredients 


Plate the salad with the lamb. Add dressing on top. Sprinkle feta, and croutons""

**READY TO EAT!!!**

Here's a picture. The picture doesn't make it look that great. It was my first time making it, and I took this picture about a week ago, before I had any plan of posting it on the internet. However, the flavors are awesome. Hope you enjoy.

Add some turmeric (which is actually mildly anti-inflammatory), about 1 1/2 teaspoons, A tablespoon of Cumin and a tablespoon of Coriander.  I usually add the juice of half a lemon or a whole lime to this but since you are on a no citrus kick, you could add a touch of vinegar to add a little acid.  Marinate the chicken for at least a few hours or overnight.  If the chicken is thin cut, broil it for about 5 to 8 minutes on each side.  If it is a thick breast or bone in thigh, bake until mostly done then broil.

This is great with some cilantro basmati rice and some steamed veg.

Another idea is dutch baby. It is an oven pancake that you start on the stove and finish in the oven.  The batter is basically some milk, butter, flour, and a bit of egg.  You pour it into an oven safe skillet that is nice and hot, pop it in the oven to bake.  When it comes out it deflates and it's fabulous with some fresh fruit, yogurt, and a sprinkling of powdered sugar on it.

Do roasted veg for a taste of something different other than steamed.  Deep, rich flavor with very little additions.  Just use a touch of oil, usually a tablespoon is enough to coat the veggies, a bit of salt and a touch of pepper and roast at a high temperature until nice and brown.  This is something that sometimes I add a touch of acid to when it comes out since some things can be really sweet when cooked this way, but they are great additions to a meal that night and leftovers are great to put in salads.

2013-05-06 01:01:26,comment,recipes,,"i'm not seeing restrictions on spices(not spicy) and herbs. I suggest you experiment adding these to food for flavor. Oregano, Cumin, Rosemary, cilantro, basil, thyme, garlic, chives, vanilla extra, cinnamon, etc... 

i'd experiment with these one at a time and keep a journal writing down the flavors you experience, whether you like it or not, and most importantly if it affects your IBS. these can take a regular plain old piece of chicken breast and turn it into something super delicious.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_herbs_and_spices

some herbs have some medicinal properties, i don't believe they are too powerful and if you are on any kind of medications check to make sure they don't interfere with the medicine. if it doesn't then it could help alleviate some symptoms to a few degrees but in combination with your diet and (if) meds it'll help a bit for in overall increase in treating ibs. which herbs does what i dunno. 

the eggs problem could it be from one part of the egg? like either the yolk or whites? if it its you could take the part out that causes problems. there are also egg substitutes but i don't know if thats on your list or not. 

i see no nuts, or dairy but i'm wondering if almond milk is a no no, i've been drinking that cause the sugar in regular milk is very very high. and the vanilla almond milk is really good and i can't tell the difference. 

also look into different cooking methods to infer flavor, smoking low fat meats, using a slow cooker, etc. 

good lucks

One of my favorite fast, easy meals with quinoa is a stir-fry with baby bok choy, mushrooms, garlic, shredded carrots, broccoli, and shrimp. I cook the quinoa separately in coconut milk. While thats cooking I sauté the shrimp and veggies in coconut oil or sesame oil. Once the shrimp is fully cooked, I mix in the quinoa and let it all cook together for about 5 minutes and then eat! You could flavor the shrimp and veggies with salt, garlic powder, and ginger powder. Ginger is also supposed to be great for the stomach/digestive tract :-). You can also substitute probably just about any protein source for the shrimp. Shrimp just happens to be my favorite, but I also love this dish with tofu.

I only have IBS, but in 7 years, it had gone from tolerable to ""I can't take this anymore."" I got to a point where I would occasionally throw up from food, but wouldn't know what caused it. I could barely eat anything and was mostly eating chicken to sustain myself because every other meat (turkey included) would make me sick. No coffee, no alcohol (that actually caused fairly severe pain for 15 minutes after half a drink), no high fat, etc. I have all of the standard IBS triggers (where most people only have some).

So far this medicine has done wonders for me. I don't have to run to the bathroom within 5 minutes of eating things, and I'm pretty sure it's stopped me from throwing up at least 2 or 3 times. I'm working on adding foods back to my diet, but so far so good. I was able to eat cookies recently, which I haven't been able to do in ages because just a wee bit of butter makes me sick. 

I've had no ill side effects from it either, which is awesome.

As far as recipes go: My go-to meal was oven-roasted chicken breast (lowest in fat) with whatever fat free dressing I felt like using. Usually raspberry vinaigrette. I cut all the fat I can off of the chicken, marinate it in the dressing, then pop it in the oven for 11 mins at 375. Marinated it again, then back in the oven for another 10. My other favorite was the same sort of thing, but stir fry instead. Same dressing, but add green peppers and maybe broccoli and use a frying pan to cook it.

I'll start: lilmissmoonshine's famous tzatziki!

one of those half-size tubs of plain greek yogurt (I don't remember the ounces, 16 I think)

2 tablespoons of mayo (I use the olive-oil based kind, mayo is optional but it adds thickness to your sauce and you really can't tell that it's there)

1 large cucumber

a half handful of FRESH dill weed

a half handful of FRESH mint leaves

4-5 garlic cloves

about a half teaspoon of garlic powder (this is the ""secret"" ingredient I think, garlic powder adds another flavor dimension that you can't get from fresh garlic)

about a half teaspoon of lemon juice

salt to taste

Basically just scrape the watery seedy center out of the cucumber and either throw away or set aside - i like to have it in a glass of chilled water - and then blend all of the ingredients together in no particular order. You can peel the cucumber if you want, I usually peel about half of it and leave the rest in the sauce because I think that makes for the prettiest shade of green. In my house tzatziki usually initially gets made for falafel night, and then gets put on everything from strawberries to sandwiches until it's used up.

Butterscotch cookies

12 Tablespoons of unsalted butter cut into tablespoon slices

1 3/4 cup dark brown sugar

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 egg

1 egg yolk

1 Tablespoon real vanilla extract

2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon baking powder


Mix dry ingredients together and whisk well.  Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment, put your dark brown sugar and salt. (or just use an electric hand mixer)

Brown 10 Tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan.  Do this carefully.  Melt it, cook it until it foams up and the foam subsides, and stir it a lot.  When it starts to brown and smell nutty, get it off the heat IMMEDIATELY.  Add in the last two Tablespoons of butter and mix until melted.  

Pour the butter in the bowl with the brown sugar and mix.  Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and mix and scrap the bowl at least once.

Add in flour in 3 increments, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl between additions.  The batter will be very thick.

In a dish, mix together 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of white sugar.  Have some good coarse salt handy, such as kosher, sea salt, fleur de sel.  DO NOT USE TABLE SALT FOR THIS PART.

Take 1/2 tablespoons of the dough, roll it in your hands into a ball, dredge in the sugar mixture and then place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment.  Place cookies about 2 inches apart.  Once the sheet is filled with sugar dredged balls of dough, sprinkle LIGHTLY with the coarse salt.  Bake at 375 for about 8 minutes if you like a little chew.  10-12 if you want them to be crunchy.

These cookies will have a crunchy exterior and chewy interior if slightly underbaked.  The coarse salt goes a long way to enhance the amazing butterscotch flavor and sweetness.  And if you use a measuring spoon, like I do, to get every cookie the exact same size, you will be accused, like me, of buying them from a bakery.",32,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/

Three tablespoons of dry italian seasoning

One tablespoon of powdered garlic

(Topping)

Half cup tomato sauce

One cup shredded mozzarella 

Oil

Prepare your breading station!

Pound the chicken breasts (or thighs if you prefer), to an even thickness throughout (butterfly if you get some really thick ones), then coat in the seasoned flour, dip in the eggwash, and then coat with the breading, make sure to pat it into the chicken.

Coat a pan in oil, medium heat, enough for a light saute or panfry (depending on how you want to control your calories), brown on both sides (do NOT cook through) and place on a baking sheet.  Spoon on a tablespoon or two of tomato sauce onto the top of each breast, spreading it evenly.  Cover in mozzarella liberally, then bake for 15-20 minutes or until proper temp. (thighs may take longer, and are more forgiving of heat)

Serve with penne or your favorite pasta.

I'm most famous in my family though for my homemade BBQ sauce, smoked hams, chicken leg quarters and my homemade seafood alfredo. I smoke the hams for 10-12 hours, the chicken for about 2 and I don't smoke the alfredo. At least not yet....

I start with 4 quarts of heavy whipping cream, start warming that in a large pan. I also saute 2 chopped onions and some diced portabella mushrooms in butter and olive oil. When it's almost done, I add about 2 or 3 garlic cloves, diced to the mushrooms and onions.

When the cream is hot enough I add one stick of butter then slowly add shredded Italian blend cheese in, adding it in 1/4 cup increments. It's usually about 4-5 cups of cheese. You stop adding when the cheese starts sticking to the whisk and not melting away. 

I then add some italian style seasonings, I have a fresh dried mix I use, and combine everything together.

I usually saute up some smaller peeled and de-veined shrimp, lobster tail pieces and mussels, adding that to the alfredo. When I want to really go all out, I'll smoke some lobster tails on the grill and put them on a bed of angel hair pasta and pour the alfredo over it all.

Put a large pot of well salted water on to boil.  While it comes to a boil, start sauce.  When it comes to a boil, add one 16 ounce box of shaped pasta (elbow, corkscrew, shells, something that holds onto sauce well).

In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, melt some butter at least 3 or 4 tablespoons and saute finely diced onion and garlic until translucent.  

Add a glob of dijon mustard (about a Tbsp), some dried thyme or oregano, a dash of cayenne (or tobasco) and sprinkle in about 2 or 3 Tbsp of flour, stir well.  If the flour comes together in a very large glob, you may need to add a touch more flour or butter/oil to smooth out the roux.  Cook the roux until ever so slightly golden.

Add in a cup of milk and mix into the roux well.  There are going to be globs for a bit, it will be fine, use a whisk to help.  Add in two more cups of milk and stir frequently over medium heat until hot and thick.

At this time, add in about 4 cups of shredded cheese.  I usually use a mix of cheeses.  My favorite blend is mozzarella, gruyere, cheddar, and fontina.  Taste the sauce and salt and pepper to taste.

Once the pasta cooks, and cook it just shy of full al dente, still a tad of crunch to it, drain and add into the sauce (which is why you need a LARGE one).  Mix well. 

Dump the whole conglomeration into a well-buttered baking dish, a 13x9x2 usually works well.  Dump more cheese on top and if you are feeling fancy, some crushed crackers or potato chips for crunch (or I've even done toasted panko dotted with a touch of butter)

Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes until the cheesy on top is melted and browned to your liking.

Season to taste with salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning (if using a tony's or other high salt content cajun seasoning, be wary, you can also look up recipes for a cajun seasoning online)

Once the ham hock has cooled, and if you desire, you can remove the little bit of meat that does reside in the ham hock, if you are using tasso, simply roughly chop the tasso and add to the pot.

2 pounds cream cheese

5 eggs

1 cup dutch processed cocoa powder

1 tablespoon vanilla

1 teaspoon orange extract

1/4 cup Grand Marnier (or other orange liquor)

1 bag MINIATURE chocolate chips (full sized chips won't melt all the way)

Float the foil cream cheese packs in a warm water bath for 10-15 min to soften, then mix with the sugar and eggs until creamy and smooth. Add in 3/4 cup cocoa powder, vanilla, orange extract and Grand Marnier. Again, mix until smooth. Add in the bag of chocolate chips and mix until they are all evenly distributed through the mix.

Take a springform cheesecake pan, coat with cooking spray and throw in the remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder. Coat the pan evenly with the cocoa powder. If there's any left over you can throw it back in the batter. This will bake into a dark chocolate crust for the cheesecake.

Bake at 200 degrees for 8 hours. I usually put it in the oven before bed. In the morning, the whole house will smell like chocolate!

Remove from oven and cool to room temp. Put it in the fridge and chill for at least two hours. Remove from fridge. Loosen the pan by holding it vertically, the weight of the cake will pull the edge away from the pan. Rotate the cake all the way around to loosen the edge completely. Put a plate on top, flip the cake upside down and remove the springform pan.

What you should see is a cheesecake that is really dark, almost black. That's the cocoa powder that has baked into a crust. I generally serve it upside down as it's more impressive that way. But once it's chilled again you can flip it right side up if you desire.

I also garnish it with those little candy oranges just for fun. It also gives people a visual heads up that this isn't just choclate flavored.

One I can actually give you the recipe for is my own creation, 

the Niceberg. 

(One brownie per Niceberg) First you make a few brownies (any will do, I'm not going to put up a brownie recipe because that's not the important part). 

(About 2/3s a cup of cream per Niceberg)Whip some cream and add some sugar to taste, not too much though or it will become too thin for its purpose.

Then make some chocolate sauce, the thicker the better, if you can't make it then buy some or melt chocolate and leave it in liquid form.

Ok you're going to need: 

a cereal bowl

a large icecream scoop

icecream (clotted cream is the choice but I'm not here to judge)

and willpower. 

First you need to know that time is going to be against you, make sure all the ingredients are cold as well as the room you're in. 

Chop the brownie into eighths. 

Scoop the surface of the icecream, don't dig the scoop too deep as you want a nice and wide cavity in the centre of your icecream. When the scoop looks solid enough and still has a wide cavity, take it out and place it upright in the bowl with the hole facing upwards. 

Now the race begins, take the whipped cream and either scoop or pipe some into the scoop of icecream, enough to fill a sixth of it. Then put in enough brownie bits to fill another sixth. Followed by a sixth of cream, another sixth of brownie, a sixth of chocolate sauce and then topped off with a crest of cream. 

Lastly, place a mint leaf in the top and dust with icing sugar. 

Note, I have no yet found a way to make more than one or two at a time without them melting so it's best for a self indulgent treat.

Make your patties with good ground beef and salt + pepper.  I usually make them in the 300 gram range - It's a bit of a colon clogger but that's just how I like it.

Cut a whole fresh pineapple into slices about 1/4-1/2 inches thick - this will sit on top of the burger.  This is also why I make the patties so big.  Dip it into a teriyaki sauce and honey mixture.  More teriyaki than honey.  Skip the honey altogether if you want.  Add peppers if you want to make it spicy.  Let the pineapple soak this up for a good half hour to an hour

Grill your burgers however you like - For this variant, I like the outside charred just shy of black with the inside at a nice medium rare.  The texture works well with the other ingredients.  Somewhere along the way, baste them with a little bit of teriyaki sauce.

While you're doing that, grill the pineapple up on high flame - 2-4 minutes each side.  

Stack it, top with bacon if you want, and serve.  Limit the veggies you serve with the burger - some baby spinach is more than plenty because of the pineapple.  Don't use lettuce.

I encourage you to build off of this to make your own favorite recipe. That's how I came across mine.

Food stuffs:  
2 packages of extra firm tofu  
a few carrots  
package of chopped portabella mushroom  
1 yellow pepper  
1 orange pepper  
jalapeno peppers to taste  
serrano peppers to taste  
any other hot pepper to taste  
1 red onion  
several fresh garlic cloves  
1 15 oz can garbanzo beans  
1 15 oz can red kidney beans  
1 16 oz can tomato sauce  
?? oz can of whole kernel corn  
1 28 oz can whole or diced tomatoes, with liquid (or you can split it up into 2 16 oz cans of different flavored tomatoes)
can of tomato paste  

Spices and flavor enhancers:  
6 tbsp chili powder  
1 tsp cumin  
1 tsp coriander  
3 tbsp paprika  
2 tsp ginger powder
ground pepper (to taste)
1 tbsp cinnamon
1/4 cup brown sugar 
bakers chocolate   
soy sauce  
1 beer (I usually go with a strong IPA)  
sriracha sauce
olive or canola oil  
bag of shredded sharp cheddar  
sour cream  


**Step 1**: Chop up all the vegetables  
**Step 2**: Drain and dice tofu into squares of desired size  
**Step 3**: Sautee tofu and garlic in oil and soy sauce and add half amount of dry ingredients (excluding the cinnamon and brown sugar) in the chili pot  
**Step 4**: Sautee garlic and hot peppers in olive oil in a HUGE frying pan  
**Step 5**: Throw veggies into frying pan with garlic and hot pepper starting with ""heavier"" veggies first and moving on to lighter veggies (ex: carrots, peppers, shrooms, onion, etc).  
**Step 6**: Add all the canned items starting with the sauce in with the pot with tofu and mix  
**Step 7**: Add veggies to the pot and mix  
**Step 8**: Pour in beer, a good helping of soy sauce, as much sriracha as you see fit, 1/4 (or more) cup of brown sugar, however much cinnamon and plenty of bakers chocolate along with remainder of dry ingredients, mix well while bringing pot to a low boil  
**Step 9**: Bring heat to low and let cook for 3 hours minimum, taking time to stir, taste test and add things as you see fit. If it's too spicy add some cheese and sour cream to the pot. The longer it cooks, the better  
  
  
For an awesome seasonal take on this, use a good pumpkin beer instead of an IPA, swap out tofu for sweet potatoes and replace garbanzo beans with black beans!

From the blog:


    200 millilitres of Sprite (you may use Ginger Ale if you prefer the taste)
    100 Millilitres of Guinness (you may use a lighter or less bitter ale/beer if you prefer – be aware that cider’s make the concoction tangy)
    2 tots (capfuls if you prefer) of Butterscotch schnapps (or 2 table spoons of butterscotch syrup, for less of a kick).
    1 egg yolk (separate the white of egg from the yolk)
    2 large tablespoons of honey
    1 large table spoon of pure butter (white butter is best)
    1 scoop of vanilla flavoured ice-cream
    a pinch of cinnamon
    a dash of nutmeg
""Pour the Sprite and Guinness into a deep set pan over a medium to high heat. Make sure to watch the contents of the pan carefully. When the solution appears to reach a boil, remove the pan from the hotplate and set the heat to low. While the solution is coming to a boil, mix and beat the following ingredients together with a whisk: egg yolk, butterscotch schnapps, honey, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. Slowly incorporate the warm solution into the mixture of ingredients, using a large serving spoon or similar equivalent, all the while continuing to beat the mixture with a whisk. This is to prevent the egg yolk from turning into scrambled eggs. Five large serving spoonfuls should do the trick. Place the Sprite and Guinness solution back onto a hotplate at a low heat. Then pour the mixture into the liquid solution and use the whisk to stir the brew. The brew should now be the colour of a medium brewed tea. Allow the brew to simmer for a few (5) minutes and then add the butter. Use the whisk to ensure the butter completely melts into the brew. Pour the brew into your desired instrument of consumption, wait 5 – 10 minutes (it tastes better when it is not too hot), then drop a scoop of vanilla flavoured ice-cream on the top, add a speckle of cinnamon and a spot of nutmeg, and ‘voila’, Butterbeer!

2-3 Lbs Chicken Breasts (add more or less meat depending on how much you like in your soup!)

3-4 Liters of clear chicken broth

Instant bag rice (easy and good for the task, but you can use regular rice)

1 large sweet potato

1 bunch celery

1 bunch green onion

1 small container of fresh thyme (you can use dried... but don't)

3 medium-large onions

2 carrots

1-2 large russet potatoes

Salt

Black Pepper

Calvendar's Greek Seasoning

Optional

Mushrooms

turnips

corn

SO, what you do is take 2 liters of chicken broth and put it in you pot. 

1. Bring it to a boil

2. Add your chicken, the sweet potato, a small handful of thyme stems (or a tablespoonish of dried) + 1 quartered onion (large pieces so that they are easy to remove.)

3. Boil for about 25-30 mins, this helps the chicken really shred up nice. When your done, poor the broth through strainer into a bowl to remove the stems, chicken, and onion. Keep the broth, half the large (or all of a smaller one) sweet potato and chicken, discard the rest.

4. Now take a 2 forks and shred the chicken as much or as little as you like. I prefer very finely, but some like chunks. Careful, it is really hot when shredding right out of the pot.

5. Put the sweet potato in a bowl and mash it to a goo. You can also just do this in the broth. Either way you don't want the skin. This part is important because it give the broth a thicker base, and is a vitamin cornucopia. Don't skip it. You can even do a whole large one if you want, but try half first.

5. Pour the broth back in your pan and add the sweet potato and chicken to the mix. add another liter of chicken broth and Bring to boil.

6. Before the broth heats up too much, use seasoning to get the states right. Just add salt, pepper, and calvendar's greek seasoning to taste. I sometimes add a splash of cayenne pepper. TIP: Under salt it a little bit. It is always easy to add salt to your bowl, but not easy to remove it.

7. While the broth is heating up, cut your veggies to whatever size you like them. For your first time making this, I suggest having them pre-prepared. It is your call how much of each to add. I usually use 1-2 large potoates, 5 good stalks of celery, 2 medium onions or 1 really big one, 1-2 carrots, and then somthing like a turnip or corn. Add ANY vegetable that sounds good to you. Potatoes/carrots go in 8 mins before anything else. Everything else can go in at the same time. Gauge your cooking time by how crunch you like your veggies (just taste them!)

8. Boil a bag of white instant rice or make a big batch on the stove, add to each bowl you prepare, NOT to the main batch.

9. If you have to many veggies, just add extra broth. When I make a big batch to eat all week I keep an extra liter around to top it off if need be. Remember, you will be adding rice to each bowl.
Note: if you want more chicken flavor, add chicken bullion, or boil more broth down.

**Ingredients:**

	Fresh Parsley
	Fresh Garlic
	Lots of Olive Oil 
	Meat: Swordfish, ideally. Chicken thighs aren't bad. Marinated tofu in desperation. 
	Eggplant; about as much in volume as you have meat
	Grape or Cherry Tomatoes
	White Wine
	Penne or other large, chunky pasta
	Brick of fresh Parmigiano Reggiano

**Directions:**

Chop garlic into chunks and add to large (12"" minimum) skillet. Add oil, and a handful of finely chopped parsley. Begin to cook down parsley and garlic. 

Dice eggplant into ~3/4"" cubes. When the parsley and garlic has infused the oil (but before the garlic gets too brown and bitter) add the eggplant, more oil, and the white wine. Salt and pepper. 

While the eggplant cooks down, put water on for the penne. 

If the eggplant soaks up all the wine and oil, add more. 

Chop the meat into similar sized chunks to the eggplant. 

When the eggplant is tender and saturated with oil, wine, and garlic, remove from pan, leaving any remaining liquid. 

Add the meat to the pan, and more oil/wine as needed. Season with salt and pepper and begin cooking. 

Slice tomatoes into halves or quarters. These make a very limited ""sauce"", which is more Sicilian style than a thick, heavy, mainland sauce. Add to the pan to cook down with the meat. 

**The Marriage:**

When the pasta is still a little underdone, and the meat is done, unite all the ingredients in the skillet. (This is why you need a big one - you might want to picture all of it piled in there ahead of time to be sure.) Mix well, drizzle with more oil and wine so the pasta soaks it up. 

When the pasta has had another minute or two to cook down, add another handful of diced parsley to the top, and grate the Parmigiano Reggiano copiously over the dish. Mix it, and add more if needed. It shouldn't be too cheesy, but should be a bit oily when you are done.

2012-11-26 20:43:05,comment,recipes,,"Drunken Master Chicken!

I apologize, as not a lot of this recipe is measured exactly--but it's one of those things I know like the back of my hand! Also, read the recipe once in its entirety before making it, cause I'm a scatter-brain and tend to write all over the place, and there are a few things that can be done simultaneously to save time.

Anyhow, this is my own, kicked up take on various General Tso's recipes I've tried. I made them, took parts I liked from them all and added my own saucy, spicy take to them.

Take some cubed chicken (white or dark, whichever you prefer) and marinate it in 2 egg whites, 2 tablespoons of Shaoxing wine, a splash of whiskey, a dash of salt and white pepper. Let that get happy for at least ten or 15 minutes--a few hours or overnight is even better. I like to let the chicken defrost in the marinade, then cube it up just before cooking.

Here's the sauce: juice one or two small oranges, and mix in a tablespoon or so of tomato paste, a few tablespoons of soy sauce, a tablespoon of sesame oil--red chili oil 'if you're nasty'--a few tablespoons of honey, about 4 chopped dried chilis (I like to use japones--leave out the seeds to use as a garnish), a tablespoon or two of hoisin sauce and sambal oelek (thai chili paste), a few cloves of minced garlic, and two or three finely-minced shallots, and a splash of rum or whiskey, whichever you feel like. Whisk all that together with a little bit of corn starch to help it thicken once you cook it.

Take a large mixing bowl and fill it up with 3 parts corn starch, one part white flour and liberal sprinklings of dried ground chipotle, black pepper, and minced garlic or garlic powder. Make sure you stir it all up to get it looking uniform and stuff.

Fill a wok or fry pan with peanut oil (or vegetable oil in a pinch) and get it up to high. Test the oil with by flicking a few drops of water into it--if they pop, it's time to cook your chicken. Toss the chicken in the cornstarch mixture until nice and coated, then use your favorite slotted spoon (I have a spider I favor for this) and shake of the excess, and put it in to the oil. Make sure you agitate it a little to keep the chicken from sticking together. A little over five minutes should do--work in batches and put it in a colander with a few paper towels in the bottom to drain.

After the chicken has drained once, let it fry a second time for a good 3 or 4 minutes. This helps it get extra crispy. Once it's looking awesome, You're gonna add a bit of oil to another frying pan/wok on medium to high heat. Then you're gonna add your chicken, and drizzle the sauce over it. Stir it quickly and constantly until the sauce thickens up. Serve it, garnished VERY SPARINGLY with the seeds from your dried chilies or toasted sesame seeds alongside rice.

Of course, nothing's exact and there's room to give or take the measurements of just about everything in the sauce, but that's pretty much the pattern I follow when I make it. I make it every time I have guests and they all seem to adore it!",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/

Great-grandmother's recipe, she won a Pillsbury Cook-Off with it in the 50's. It may not sound that appetizing to some, but it's quite delicious, and in my opinion it's one of those dishes that's better the next day.

.

Ingredients:

1-1.5 lb ground beef, lean

1/2 an onion, small dice

2-3 cloves of garlic, minced

8 oz cream cheese

8 oz of fresh broccoli, medium dice, (mostly the flower part, frozen is fine too)

8 oz of Monterrey Jack cheese, sliced (pepper jack if you like stuff a little spicy)

2 Pillsbury crescent roll packages, plain, butter, or garlic flavored (the regular shape, not the big kind or any other variation)

.

You will also need:

-Large frying pan

-Cooking spray

-Glass or ceramic round pie dish

.

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F
1. Brown ground beef in a large frying pan over medium heat, strain off fat.
1. While the beef is cooking, spray a pie dish with cooking spray and line the bottom and sides with one of the packages of crescent rolls(I recommend leaving them in the fridge until this step since they will be easier to work with) making sure that all the perforations have been pressed together, do not trim off the extra. ([Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/3YGv0.png))
1. Add onion and garlic to the beef, cook for a few minutes over medium heat until onion is translucent.
1. Incorporate cream cheese into beef mixture, continue cooking on low heat to help melt cream cheese.
1. Stir in broccoli and remove from heat.
1. Place beef mixture into newly made pie shell and spread evenly.
1. Completely cover with the Jack cheese.
1. Using the same method as before, arrange the second package of crescent rolls to form a top crust for your pie. Make sure to seal the edges, then trim the excess dough and discard or add evenly to the edge of the pie to make a bigger crust.
1. Bake for 30 minutes or until nicely browned on top, Remove from oven and let rest for 10-15 minutes.

.

A few notes:

-Do not make the top crust ahead of time, it just becomes very difficult to work with.

-If you plan to cook the meat mixture ahead of time and put it in the fridge, do not place it in the pie shell(will not cook properly), if you do refrigerate the meat mixture, be sure to reheat it before putting it in the pie shell(again, it won't cook properly otherwise).

-If using frozen broccoli, heat it in a sauce pan first before adding to beef mixture, also be sure to strain as much water off as possible so the pie doesn't get soupy.

1 cup ketchup
1 cup BBQ sauce

3 tablespoons of mustard (trust me)

1/2 cup of chopped green onion
3 gloves garlic
Pinch of powdered ginger
3-4 lemons juice

Mix all of the ingredients except the kabob mix in a large mixing bowl. Taste it.  I usually add more BBQ or ketchup sauce if I want to sweeten it, leave out the kabob mix to make it less spicy, add more lemon for a tangy taste and so on depending on how it tastes at this point.

Cut the chicken however you like. Smaller pieces are obviously easier to marinate. I usually cut it into small 1x3 chunks. Larger pieces aren't a problem though, the lemon will help it marinate.

Using a gallon zip lock bag you can marinate 2 pounds of chicken per bag. Don't use off brand bags they may bust. Leave in fridge for 2-4 hours, some say overnight will make the chicken mush but I've never had that problem and I prefer the deeper flavor :).

Prepare however you like, BBQ is ideal but you can do it on a stove top if the pieces are small enough and you have enough patience.

The easiest way to prepare is bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes until thoroughly cooked.

*  Chicken, cut up into a proper cutlet size
*  Flour
*  Eggs
*  Panko Breadcrumbs (I like to use Kikoman, but you can use any kind)
*  Peanut Oil
*  Salt and Pepper
*  Spices

First, tenderize the chicken (bang it with the tenderizing hammer or poke holes with a fork).  Then make the brime (mix enough water to cover the ckicken, a lot of salt, less sugar and less paprika, cayenne and cumin.  The water should look orange red).  Stick the chicken in the brime for at least 1-2 hours, but it can be for longer.

Next, prepare your dredges.  Mix some pepper in the flour, and I like putting in garlic powder and a bit of no-salt seasoning, even a bit of paprika.  Then, mis up the egg.  Lastly, take out the panko.  I like adding italian seasoning to this, but I don't think it really does much to the flavor.  

Heat up the peanut oil (you don't need to use a deep fryer but make sure your skillet is deep enough to cover the chicken).  When a bit of flour in the oil starts to bubble, it's time to put in yo chicken.  Dredge the chicken in flour, then egg, then heavily in the panko.  Stick it in the skillet so that it becomes golden brown (you might have to turn down the heat so it doesn't burn before the chicken is cooked).  Serve with whatever you want.

You need:
*  Potatoes
*  water
*  Oil
*  Optional:  Beer Batter:  1 cup flour to 8 oz beer, add paprika, onion powder or whatever you want.

Cut up potatoes into desired fry size.  Boil the water (don't add salt to the water unless you like your fries salty).  They should be firm but fairly well cooked.  Then, fry them but not all the way.  If you make a lot and want to freeze some of them, now is the time to do so.  Next, make the beer batter and dip the fries (which should be cooled a bit) in the beer batter and fry them again.

[picture from an old batch](http://i.imgur.com/Jbs3I.jpg)

Here's the recipe I have on hand to email to people who ask.  Don't remember where I got it, but I spent a year going through different recipes and making adjustments to get it to where I like it.

**￼Dough:**

*  4 1/2 tsp dry yeast 
* 1 C warm water
* 2/3 C sugar
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 C warm milk
* 2/3 C butter
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 eggs slightly beaten 7 C flour

1) In a small bowl. Mix the water, yeast, 1 tsp sugar, and set aside

2) In a large bowl mix the milk, 2/3 C sugar, butter (melted), and eggs.

3) Stir in the yeast mixture.

4) Add in half the flour and salt.

5) Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough is slightly stiff (depending altitude,
humidity, room temp, and flour density the final amount used will vary).

6) Place in a plastic/ceramic/glass bowl (with plenty of room) covered until doubled in
size. (1 to 3 hours. Usually about 1.5 hours)

**Filling:**

* 1 C Melted Butter 
* 1 3/4 C Sugar
* 1/2 C Brown Sugar 
* 3 Tblsp cinnamon

1) Preheat oven to 350 Degrees

2) Spread dough into a 1/8th inch thick rectangle

3) Spread the butter on the dough

4) Mix the sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon and sprinkle on the butter

5) Roll up the dough and cut with a bread knife into roughly 1.5 inch slices (I probably
cut them closer to 2”)

6) Place on a greased pan with 1” separation.

7) Bake 25 to 30 min


*On filling amount / options:*

- The filling recipe makes a lot of filling. I usually use about half of what the recipe calls for so the rolls aren’t too gooey and sweat. The more you use the gooier the roll.

- You can also add raisons / walnuts if you like (my kids don’t). You can also get fancy and add some orange and/or lemon zest to give it a slight citrus flavor

- I usually “grease the baking pan with the butter and filling so the sides and bottom of the cinnamon roll have that filling taste.

*￼On which baking pan to use:*

- you can use a standard cookie sheet and that’s fine. The rolls will spread out during baking. I like to use a round cake pan and place the rolls a little closer together. This will cause the rolls to be forced to spread more in the up direction than out. The down side is that at the end of the 25 min the bottoms/centers won’t be cooked all the way, and if you leave it up the tops will over cook. At about the 20 min mark I dump the cakepans upside down onto cookie sheets and bake the remaining 10 min.

**Icing:**

* 2/3C + 1tblsp melted buter 
* 4 C powder sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 4 to 8 tsp hot water

1) Mix all ingredients

2) Add hot water until desired consistancy 3) Spread on hot rolls


Again you can add some orange zest, and/or half the vanilla and have the other half be almond extract.
I usually add about 12 tsp of hot water so the icing becomes a thinner glaze that I can just smother the rolls in.
You can cut the recipe in half and then add dutch cocoa powder to one of the halfs to create a chocolate version. Then keeping them both thick you can pipe them in perpendicular lines.
Other options including adding cinnamon for more cinnamon flavor, coffee powder, etc.

2012-11-27 00:57:23,comment,recipes,,"I make really good beans.  The secret ingredient is beer.

* Dice/chop an onion, sautee it in a generous amount of olive oil for a while.

* After a few minutes, throw in a diced chipotle pepper (the adobo sauce kind) and/or an assortment of diced fresh hot peppers if you have them.  Any spare bell peppers go in as well.

* After the sauteeing has gone nicely, add the beans (rinsed) and some diced tomatoes.  I usually go 2 cans black beans, 1 can kidney beans, but it can be all black beans, especially if you cook them from dry.  1 std-size can diced tomatoes.  

* It's still not liquidy enough.  Add maybe a quarter of a bottle of really nice beer.  The spicing should complement the beer, the rest of this assumes a really hoppy IPA.  I've also had really good results with belgians, oaky pale ales and good pale ales.

* Add spices.  Cinnamon (maybe half a teaspoon to start?), cocoa (maybe half a teaspoon to start, this can go overboard and make pudding), cumin (be generous), chili pepper powders if it's not spicy enough, tarragon, salt and black pepper.

* Bring to medium heat and let it cook down.

* Now that it's almost dry, add more beer!  You should use at least half a bottle altogether, probably more.  It really brightens things up.  Oh, some lime juice too.

* Cook it down more, tasting.  Cumin for smoke, chili pepper powder for spice, tarragon for, uh, green?, cinnamon for cinnamon, cocoa powder for darkness, lime juice for bright acid, beer for hoppy florality, etc.  Your beans should take on a half-refried sort of look.

* If you feel like it, and if it needs to mellow, add a quarter cup whole milk.

You can eat them with rice, but my favorite is to put them and cheese on tortillas and make quesadillas.",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/

Heat up 2 bottles of Hornsby's Hard Cider in a sauce pan (Med-high heat).
Add a little over a cup of sugar, mix (you're making a bit of a syrup here)

Add cinnamon sticks, whole allspice, some whole cloves, and apple peels. Let all that stew. Should taste like a cinnamon cider with some bite.

After it's all settled (will take a while for all the flavors to mix together), filter out any of the sediment that might have settled. The most effective filtration that won't take forever will be a french press.

Add about a cup of Jack Daniels (or whatever whiskey you like, but then it can't be called AppleJack). There you have it.

2012-11-27 02:23:47,comment,recipes,,"Mine is still a work in progress (my dad and I don't follow recipes when we cook, so me writing a recipe down is pretty new). My fathers' cousins are Korean, and when I was younger we used to go over and we'd have hand made bulgogi and dumplings. Since I've grown up and been getting into cooking the past couple years I've decided to bring that nostalgia of visiting that hard to see part of the family. I've been slowly tweaking this via trial and error and there are a couple of things in here that may seem questionable, but just trust me.

**So for about 1.7 lbs of thinly sliced Rib Eye and 1/2 a yellow onion**  *(You might wanna do a full onion; I have a love/hate relationship with them because I hate onions but I understand you can't hope to get anywhere in cooking without them)*

* 3 Tbsp Brown Sugar
* 2 Tbsp Toasted Sesame Seeds
* 5 Cloves Garlic
* Roughly 1 Tbsp Minced Ginger
* 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper
* 1/4 Tsp Red Pepper
* 1/2 Tsp Sesame Oil
* 1 1/2 Tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar
* 1 1/2 Tbsp White Wine
* 1/3 Cup Soy Sauce
* 1/6 Cup Water

Mix all the listed ingredients (except meat & onions) in a bag of appropriate size for how much everything (including meat & onions) will take up. This can sit for a while if you'd like or if you have the time to let it. Before cooking you want to put the onions & meat in and let marinade for 30 minutes. Take out and flash grill it and put on whatever you like.

EDIT; I personally use a bag for marinading, because I can make sure everything gets an efficient amount of the marinade and it's one less dish to clean up later. Also this recipe can be scaled pretty easily, since IMHO 1.7 lbs of thin sliced rib eye is not a lot of meat.",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/

I feel kind of criminal taking credit for this stuff, but, ehn.  The three desserts I make most commonly are:

Pumpkin Cheesecake:

3 8oz blocks of cream cheese, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1 15oz can pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, 2 tablespoons vanilla, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg.  Beat together, throw in a couple of premade graham cracker pie crusts (this recipes yields three cheesecakes, because as mentioned,  I have lots of family) bake for ~an hour at 350, serve with whipped cream.

Mint Brownies:

make brownies according to directions on the box.

Mix one cup confectioner's sugar with ~2 tablespoons of milk and 1 teaspoon of mint extract.  Add green food coloring if desired.  Allow brownies to cool completely and add icing. Top with crushed andes mints. (they sell pre-crushed packs in the bakery section of wal-mart)

Strawberry Nutella Pie:

3/4 cup nutella mixed with 8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar.  Spread into pie crust (I get premade chocolate ones) and top with about ~1 pound of slices strawberries.  I used to put a strawberry glaze on top of that, but it tastes just fine without it.

I also make a pasta dish that my boyfriend has been offered money for when he brings it to work:

Cook and drain desired pasta.  I like angel hair spaghetti, but any kind of pasta will do.

in a large pan, brown about three or four minced cloves of garlic with some olive oil (a few tablespoons, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan).  Slice up some bell peppers (I use red and green most of the time, but I prefer yellow, orange and red when I can get them) and then take a pound of peeled shrimp (I get the pre cooked kind from the frozen section at the grocery store, thaw it and peel it) and let that cook.  Add onion powder, shredded fresh basil and salt to taste, then a jar of alfredo sauce, and about 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce of choice.

I'll make large cubes or strips from several chicken breasts, and chop up some onions/peppers/ into large-ish pieces, and if I have carrots, smaller pieces.  If I feel like being starchy, sweet potatoes instead of the other veggies makes for a really great chicken and potatoes kind of meal.

Anyway, sauce will be equal parts oil and whatever wine I have on hand, seasoned with lots of garlic, pepper, seasoned salt, cilantro, various spices, just whatever would go well together and is on-hand.  Stir it up well, and marinate the chicken and veggies for a couple hours.  Then I'll wrap a half strip of bacon around the chicken and skewer it.  Depending on the veggies, it's either all mixed together on skewers or separated based on cooking time.

My ""secret"" really isn't a secret.  People want to cook things as fast as possible, but my idea is so slow roast it on the grill on low heat until everything is basically cooked through.  Then I crank the heat, char it a bit on each side, and then pour the leftover marinade on at the end and let it flare up briefly for a really good seasoned ""char"" on the outside.

350 F pre-heated oven  
4 quart pot or a 12"" high-wall skillet  
2 quart or more casserole dish (note: 2-quart Anchor casserole dish fits perfectly)  

* 1 lb ground meat (we use chicken/fresh turkey)  
* 1 Medium to large onion diced  
* 3-4 cloves of garlic   
* 1 can of pinto beans (drained)  
* 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained)  
* 1 can of Campbell's Condensed Tomato Soup + water to desired consistency  
* ~1/2 cup to 1 cup of brown sugar, to taste  
* 1/8 tsp Cayenne Pepper powder  
* 3-4 strips of bacon (required)  
* Dash Worcestershire sauce (optional)

In a large pan brown meat, then add onions and garlic to cook until fragrant. Add beans, tomato and soup (in order is the easiest).  

Add Cayenne powder, adjust for desired spicy level (we don't make it spicy, so if you want to up the spice feel free). Add the brown sugar, to desired sweetness level, we typically eyeball it to about 3/4 cup. 

Cut/tear up bacon into moderately small bits and place into pan and stir to evenly distribute. Place into casserole dish and then place into oven for 20-30 minutes.

3 cups beef or lamb stock


Place the rosemary, thyme, bay leaf and cloves into cheesecloth and secure with twine. This will be your bouquet garni.

For the shanks, pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Shanks will brown better when they are dry. Season each shank with salt and freshly ground pepper. Dredge the shanks in flour, shaking off excess.

In a large Dutch oven pot, heat vegetable oil until smoking. Add shanks to the hot pan and brown all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove browned shanks and reserve.

In the same pot, add the onion, carrot and celery. Season with salt at this point to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables. Saute until soft and translucent. Add the tomato paste and mix well. Return browned shanks to the pan and add the wine and reduce liquid by half, about 5 minutes. Add the bouquet garni and 2 cups of the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone. Check every 15 minutes, turning shanks and adding more stock as necessary.

**This is VERY important! DO NOT--I REPEAT DO NOT add anything else.**

Guacamole is like the Mexican Catsup.  You do NOT modify catsup by adding cilantro because it does not make it better.

Grind those 5 ingredients in a blender
peel the avocados, add the garlic and salt, juice the lime into the mixture (this keeps the flavor and the mixture green) and heat to taste.

I've looked up self-publishing cookbooks and it's actually quite affordable and there are lots of vendors to choose from.  

I think it could do really well.  There are some really large subreddits revolving around food and the book could target those groups.  Sections could include simple meals (for the college kid with a limited budget and few cooking utensils available) as well as more advanced recipes for the 'foodies', more 'exotic' recipes from redditors around the globe.  I'm also down for being a 'test kitchen' as I'm always looking for new recipes.  I've also got a nice DSLR camera and could contribute photos or we could recruit some more seasoned photographers from /r/FoodPorn.  Could even include some 'reddit legendary recipes' like the 2am chili, shooter sandwiches, etc.  I've already put a lot of thought into it, probably best to start a separate discussion group.

I went ahead and created a private subreddit, I'll PM you the details and add you.  If anyone else wants to be an active participant feel free to send me a PM.

2012-11-26 19:51:42,comment,recipes,,"People love my mashed potatoes too.  I have been tinkering with my technique for years, not necessarily the ingredients.  I only use Yukon golds.  Boil until soft, mash over low heat to release the steam and smooth out the lumps as much as possible.  Continue mashing potatoes while adding a stick and half of salted butter (room temp works best).  Add a whole packet of cream cheese (also room temp - I just take it out of the fridge about an hour before mashing and set it near the stove in case it doesn't get soft by then), keep mashing.  Add 3/4 cup half-n-half.  I use a brand called Snowville Creamery, which is regional to Ohio and our neighboring states.  Salt and pepper to taste, add a teaspoon-ish of Lawry's seasoning salt.  Sometimes I add some other stuff if I'm feeling fancy, but this usually covers all my bases.  

Also: Heavenly Potatoes.

Idaho red potatoes, boil until soft.  Mash the same way as above, replacing cream cheese with sour cream.  Add a cup of cottage cheese (small curd works best, but you could go with large curd for enhanced mouth feel).  Sautee some fresh minced garlic and onion to taste, add to mash.  Add some fresh/dried thyme depending on what you have to taste level preferred.  The result is a little more runny than average mashed potatoes, but no matter; it's excellent as a dip and amazing with a nice medium-rare steak.

2012-11-27 10:56:58,comment,recipes,,"**Creme Brulee French Toast**

_Toast_

1 loaf unsliced bread of your choice

1 1/3 cups whole milk

2/3 cup heavy cream

4 large eggs

1/3 cup granulated sugar

1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt

1 teaspoon Grand Marnier or another orange liqueur (or 1/4 teaspoon orange zest)

2 teaspoons vanilla extract (or 1 vanilla bean)

_Topping_

2/3 cup granulated sugar

* Cut bread into 1 1/2-inch thick, generous slices; a 9-inch loaf should yield 6 slices.  
* Whisk together milk, cream, eggs, sugar, salt, liqueur, and vanilla extract.  
(If using a vanilla bean, halve it lengthwise and scrape the pulp into a small dish. Whisk vanilla bean with one tablespoon of the custard, then whisk in another and a third tablespoon, then pour the vanilla bean-custard mixture back into the main batter. This avoids having vanilla bean clumps that don’t disperse in your batter.)

* Preheat oven to 325. Arrange bread slices on the smallest rimmed tray that will fit them in one layer (encourages maximum absorption) pour custard over slices. Allow them to absorb the custard for 30 minutes, turning the slices over at one point to ensure they’re soaking it up evenly. [Do ahead: I soak them overnight in the fridge. No need to flip them if so, and breakfast is nearly ready in the morning.]
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer custard-soaked slices to prepared sheet, arranging them with a smidge of space between each to avoid making one French mega-toast. 
* Flipping them halfway through if you wish, bake French toast slices for 30 - 35 minutes (slightly longer if you let the bread soak overnight), until a slim knife inserted into the center of a slice and twisted ever-so-slightly does not release any wet custard. 
* Keep warm until ready to serve.

To caramelize the tops: Either leave toasts on their baking sheet, or transfer to a serving platter. Have ready a small offset spatula and a potholder or trivet to rest your caramel pot on.

* Melt 2/3 cup sugar in a small, heavy, completely dry saucepan over moderate heat, stirring with a small spoon or fork until fully melted and the color of honey.
* Move it over to the potholder or trivet you’d set up and working quickly, spoon one generous tablespoon caramel over your first slice of toast, spread it thinly and evenly with your offset spatula and repeat with the remaining toasts. Because your caramel will continue to deepen slightly in color (veering towards too-toasty, as was the case in my first attempt) as you work, it’s best to work quickly but carefully. 
* Let no fingers or forearms be harmed in the melted sugar’s path and should a single drop land on the counter or on your towel or on the rim of the plate, do not swipe it. Just leave it until it cools.

(Hot water will melt all hardened caramel and make your clean up job easy. Simply soak your pot/spoon/spatula and all will melt off.)

Serve with fresh berries and if you’re feeling extra fancy, loosely whipped cream (I made my own to go along with the strawberries served with breakfast). ",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/

2012-11-27 03:22:13,comment,recipes,,"Almost correct my friend.  I have the master recipe.  There is no need for any Jello pudding if you have the secret.  You are almost there.

With this recipe I caused childhood friends to never again speak when i brought it to a dinner and after taking one bite the childhood friend pretended she had to use the facilities and instead stole and hid the remaining half the cake (with my bundt pan)in her luggage to bring home so no one got seconds and there was none left for the hostess's breakfast the next morning - she discovered the theft when she went to steal it herself so she didn't have to share it with her husband, children and guests the next morning.

I have another friend on a low carb diet who refused my offer to take a slice home with her after thanksgiving, turn around after her two hour drive home to come back and beg for a slice at nearly midnight because she was tormented by her refusal and unable to think of anything else but pumpkin cake all night.

I saw a grown man cry (my boss, and hardly drunk at all) when his wife mistakenly put a dollop of whipped cream on his slice - he couldn't bear the thought that she had messed with the most perfect thing he had ever eaten.

I can't decide if the key to world peace or world destruction is in my 
recipe, but it is surely one or the other.

2012-11-27 16:36:48,comment,recipes,,"Okay, cake was found online somewhere.  It's VERY rich.

Sour Cream Chocolate Cake

2 cups All Purpose Flour

2 1/2 cups sugar

3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably dutch process (can use regular)

2 teaspoons baking soda

1 teaspoon salt

1 cup neutral oil (veg, canola, soybean, etc)

1 cup sour cream

1 1/2 cups water

2 Tablespoons distilled white vinegar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees, butter bottoms and sides of 3 8-inch pans and line bottom with parchment.

Sift flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl (I do this directly into my stand mixer bowl).  Add the oil and sour cream, mix.  Gradually beat in water and I do mean gradually.  I typically just use half a cup of water at a time, turn the mixer on medium low and drizzle it in and let it incorporate.  Add vinegar and vanilla and mix.  Add eggs and mix.  Scrape the bowl repeatedly through the process.  I usually give it a good mix at close to medium speed for about 60 seconds to make sure all is well combined.

Divide between cake pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until tester comes out almost clean.  Let cool in pans for 20 minutes or so then run a knife around the edges and invert onto wire racks and cool completely.  Warning: This is a SOFT cake so you may want to arrange things so that you can take them from the cooling racks to the fridge or even better the freezer with little to no handling.  You will thank me later for this part.

While the cakes are chilling make the Peanut Butter Frosting!

10 ounces of cream cheese at room temp

1 stick of unsalted butter at room temp

5 cups of confectioners sugar, sifted

2/3 cup of smooth peanut butter (you do not want to use a natural here since they separate)

Large bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy.  Add the confectioners sugar about a cup at a time and mix thoroughly, scrape the bowl often.  Once all the sugar is in, beat on medium until really light and fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the peanut butter and blend well, scrape and blend another minute more.

To assemble, I have learned from trial and error, start with COLD cake.  Level the tops of two of them.  Place one leveled cake layer on your plate or stand, add a good 1/2 cup or so of frosting, spread to edges, add second leveled layer, more frosting, add final layer dome side up.  Take a good length of aluminum foil and wrap around the cake to form a support tube, place in fridge to let everything set, THEN do your crumb coat and final coat with the frosting.

2012-11-27 13:14:28,comment,recipes,,"here is the best one i have come across so far.. it's from Guy Fieri. it's for his catfish recipe.. but I used it with Chicken.

Ingredients

    2 tablespoons paprika
    1 teaspoon cayenne
    1 teaspoon dried thyme
    1 teaspoon chili powder
    2 teaspoons garlic powder
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    2 teaspoons sea salt
    1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    4 (6-ounce) catfish fillets
    2 tablespoons canola oil
    2 tablespoons butter
    4 lemon wedges

Directions

On a plate, mix together the paprika, cayenne, thyme, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper for the blackened spice mixture. Dredge the catfish fillets in the spice mixture and set aside.

Heat a large cast iron fry pan or saute pan over high heat until it is ""white hot"".

Add oil to pan. When oil begins to slightly smoke, add catfish fillets and cook on each side, about 2 to 3 minutes. Cook in batches, if necessary, and transfer cooked fillets to a preheated 200 degree F oven while cooking remaining fillets.

To serve, top each fillet with 1/2 tablespoon of butter and serve with lemon wedges. ",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13syy4/what_recipe_are_you_famous_for/
